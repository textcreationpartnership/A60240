            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATOUR TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IF at anytime a Book of this nature hath been uſefull, it ſeems now to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; when moſt men think themſelves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make a buſtle for proſelyting others to their Opinions, and yet are not certain wherein they differ one from another, or how far they agree together. Difference will ſtill be difference, though, (to uſe a word well known at this time) it may be trimm'd under a diſguiſe of Conformity: And therefore to prevent the miſtakes and diſappointments that thoſe who labour about ſo good a Work, as the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting of Chriſtians, under one and the ſame Belief, may meet with from Prejudice, Intereſt, or Artifice; perhaps not one thing may be more effectual, than the true ſtating of the Faith and Opinions of others; who, if they be ingenuous, will never be complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of their Perſwaſions, nor look upon them as Friends, who would impoſe upon
<pb facs="tcp:107630:3"/>them, for friendſhip ſake, what is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with their Principles.</p>
            <p>It were to be wiſhed indeed, that all men were of one mind, if Providence which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the World thought it convenient it ſhould be ſo, but ſince it hath been foretold, that Offences muſt come, it were to be deſired at leaſt, that all knew the minds one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſo they might rightly underſtand how to rectifie miſtakes, or confirm the truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men. In order to that uſefull diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, probably none of thoſe many, who have laboriouſly ſifted the truth by their Criticks, deſerve the Title of Candid and Impartial Judges, better than Father <hi>Simon,</hi> the Learned Authour of this Treatiſe, who through the whole Book has employed his great Talent with ſo much Integrity and Diſenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedneſs, that one may ſay of him, <hi>Amicus Papa, Amici Graeci, Amici Latini, ſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis Amica Veritas.</hi> And therefore when this Book came recommended from beyond Sea, and that I peruſed it; I thought that I could hardly, in my low Station, doe better ſervice to the publick, than to render it into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh;</hi> eſpecially ſeeing the whole deſign of it is, to clear matter of fact from miſtakes, and aſperſions, and the Belief and Practice of the Eaſtern Chriſtians from the Erroneous No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that at this diſtance, may be given us of them by the Travellers and Writers of all
<pb facs="tcp:107630:3"/>ſorts. And though, the Authour diſcourſes largely of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> as being the belief of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, the Reader will eaſily perceive that he never meant to enter into the merits of the cauſe, and to diſpute the truth of the Doctrine, which peradventure may ſeem (in the Author's Opinion) very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be attempted by Humane Reaſon; but barely to aſſert and relate matter of fact, which it is fit all ſhould know: Nor, indeed, could he have uſed, in my weak Judgment, a meaner Argument either for or againſt that Doctrine, than the belief of an ignorant and oppreſt People, ſeeing Proteſtants that weigh things, are not ſtartled or moved by the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which they know to be maintained and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a Church far more conſpicuous both for Freedom, Wealth and Learning than that of the forlorn <hi>Greeks.</hi> The truth is, the Learned Authour of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe lately publiſhed againſt <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> manages the Controverſie much better, and reaſons more cloſely to the point; when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his other Arguments, he aſſigns the time that that Doctrine came to be eſtabliſhed in the Church, to be when Image-Worſhip was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> which to me is as ſtrong an Argument as any that Father <hi>Simon</hi> has produc'd, to prove that the <hi>Greeks</hi> who own that Council, and are very Superſtitious in Image-Worſhip, have ever
<pb facs="tcp:107630:4"/>ſince entertained that belief, ſeeing no attempt was ever uſed before the Reformation, to convince them of the contrary.</p>
            <p>Since then the onely deſign of this Book is to relate matter of Fact, and to clear the truth from miſtakes, I Queſtion not but that it will be ſo well taken, that even thoſe Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons who have aſſerted in Print ſome things which they will find here contradicted, may not diſlike what I have done (who am very carefull not to offend in any thing againſt the publick) in ſetting it forth in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and ſince they or their Friends want not Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to defend the truth, they cannot be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to want Modeſty and Sincerity (if convinc'd) to acknowledge a miſtake.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Belief and Cuſtoms of the Modern <hi>Greeks.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SEEING all the Sects that are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Eaſtern Countries, have ſprung from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſome particular Points, for which they have ſeparated from them, they agree in the reſt of their Belief and Ceremonies, it is neceſſary that we treat firſt of the Religion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> before we come to thoſe others that depend upon it.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:107630:6"/>
               <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> Church ſubject to the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was not always of that vaſt extent, to which it attained after that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Eaſtern Emperours to leſſen other Patriarchates for greatening that of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> which they could the more eaſily do, becauſe their Power, as to things of that Nature, hath been far greater than that of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of the VVeſt, and that for erecting of new Biſhopricks, or granting new Rights and Juriſdictions, they ſtood but very little on the conſent of Patriarchs; whereas in the Weſtern Church, the Popes by Degrees have become Supreme in theſe Affairs, and Princes muſt now have their recourſe to them.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral Liſts of Churches which are ſubject to that of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ancient, and do not ſufficiently inform us of the Extent to which that Church pretends, we ſhall produce two that are later, one made by a <hi>Greek</hi> not much known, called <hi>Nilus Doxapatrius,</hi>
                  <note n="(1)" place="margin">See the Liſts that are at the End of the Book. <hi>A.</hi>
                  </note> and related by <hi>Leo Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latius.</hi> And the other mentioned in the Letter of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
                  <note n="(2)" place="margin">In the ſame Place. <hi>B.</hi>
                  </note> concerning the Preſent State of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which he aſſures us he had from ſome <hi>Greeks</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Both theſe Liſts are in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> ſubjoined to the end of this Treatiſe. Let it now ſuffice us to obſerve here, that moſt of the <hi>Greek Metropolitans</hi> ſtill retain certain Dignities or Titles of Honour, which diſtinguiſh them one from another; ſo that when the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> writes to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, nay and to ſome Biſhops, he never fails to give them their Titles, even in the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble State to which they are at preſent redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107630:6"/>The <hi>Greeks,</hi> in all times, have been nice in diſtinguiſhing themſelves by Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and by lofty and magnificent Names: which by many is attributed to an Oriental vanity: whilſt they who are more ſparing in Cenſure, will attribute it to their Politeneſs and Civility. Though the Church of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> hath loſt the great Splendour, which it enjoyed under Chriſtian Emperours, yet the Churchmen ſtill take to themſelves Titles of Honour and Pompous Names, of which they are proud. Nor are the <hi>Monks</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious free from that Ambition; And that's the reaſon why Modern <hi>Greek</hi> VVriters attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute commonly to themſelves ſuch kinds of Titles, and prefix them to their Books; as, for inſtance, Doctour of the Great Church, and the like, which do not always excuſe them from the ignorance wherein they are plunged. But let us now ſpeak of their Belief.</p>
               <p>Since the <hi>Greek</hi> Church hath been reduced to the ſad State wherein we ſee it at preſent, the <hi>Latins</hi> have impoſed many things upon them without cauſe, and the Emiſſaries have often called them Hereticks without any ground. But, at length, ſome Learned Men at <hi>Rome</hi> under Pope <hi>Urban</hi> VIII. perceived the ignorance of the <hi>Latin</hi> Divines, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for Hereſie what ever they had not learnt in their Schools. This hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obſerved by an Authour who publiſhed his Travels to Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> with ſome pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large Remarks, wherein he explains the Theology of the Eaſtern Churches. That Authour alledges, that the <hi>Latins</hi> often accuſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> of Innovation, without any reaſon,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107630:7"/>and that if Theology were traced to its ſource, it would be found that the <hi>Greeks have ſtuck</hi> cloſer to Antiquity than the <hi>Latins</hi> have done.</p>
               <p>We have, of late, ſome learned VVorks on that Subject, which ſeem to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by an Authour, that hath ſolidly refuted what the ableſt Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> alledged in that matter. However, I think the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Notes upon <hi>Gabriel of Philadelphia</hi> hath come neareſt the Truth, by keeping a mean betwixt both Parties, and diſtinguiſhing the new <hi>Greeks</hi> who have read the Books of the <hi>Latins,</hi> or have ſtudied in their Schools, from thoſe who have had no Commerce with them; he confeſſes that the former agree more with the <hi>Latins</hi> than the other, at leaſt as to the manner of Expreſſion. The Authour of the Remarks on the Voyage to Mount <hi>Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> hath gone farther: for the affirms that the Modern <hi>Greeks</hi> do for moſt part but Copy the Books of the <hi>Latins;</hi> not following in all things the Sentiments of their Forefathers; and beſides, that their minds being raiſed but little above Popular traditions, they take no pains to ſearch for Divinity in its Original. Nay he adds, that the VVorks of <hi>Gabriel</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> though he be in the Number of thoſe who are not reunited to the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, are no more but a medly of the Theology of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins;</hi> which is chiefly to be underſtood of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and expreſſions. P. <hi>Morin</hi> was alſo of that opinion, when in his VVorks of Penance and Ordinations, he ſpeaks of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:107630:7"/>
               <p>If we follow that Principle, which is very well grounded in theſe two Authours, we ſhall more eaſily diſcover what the Belief of the <hi>Greeks</hi> is, and it will be no hard matter to reconcile the different Opinions of thoſe who have written on that Subject. I could not, in my Judgment, make the Belief of the Modern <hi>Greeks</hi> more apparent; than by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the Catalogue which <hi>Caucus</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Corfou</hi> hath made of the Errours which he imputes to them; and by adding at the ſame time, ſome neceſſary Reflexions for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing what is true from what is falſe in that matter, which hath been variouſly treated by different Authours.</p>

               <p n="1">I. They re-baptiſe all the <hi>Latins</hi> that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their Communion.</p>
               <p n="2">II. They delay the Baptiſm of Children untill the third, fourth, fifth, ſixth, tenth and eighteenth Year of their Age.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Of the ſeven Sacraments of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, they admit not Confirmation, nor Extreme Unction.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. They deny Purgatory, though they pray for the Dead.</p>
               <p n="5">V. They acknowledge not abſolutely the Primacy of the Pope.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. They deny that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Catholick Church, and that ſhe is Miſtreſs of all other Churches. They even prefer their own Church before the <hi>Latin</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:107630:8"/>Church, and on <hi>Holy Thurſday</hi> excommunicate the Pope, and all the <hi>Latin</hi> Biſhops as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. They deny that the Holy Ghoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. They refuſe to adore the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Maſs of <hi>Latin</hi> Prieſts who conſecrate in unleavened bread, according to the ancient Cuſtome of the Roman Church confirmed by the Council of <hi>Florence.</hi> Nay they waſh the Altars on which the <hi>Latins</hi> have celebrated, and will not ſuffer <hi>Latin</hi> Prieſts to celebrate upon their Altars, becauſe they pretend that the Sacrifice ought to be performed with lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. They ſay that the Ordinary words wherein the <hi>Latins</hi> make the Conſecration to conſiſt, are not ſufficient to change the Bread and the Wine into the Body and Bloud of our Lord, if ſome Prayers and Benedictions of the Fathers be not added.</p>
               <p n="10">X. They affirm that the Communion under both kinds is to be given to Children, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can diſtinguiſh that Nouriſhment from another, becauſe that is a matter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right. And therefore they give the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to Children immediately after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and they account the <hi>Latins,</hi> who are of a contrary Judgment, Hereticks.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. They hold that Lay-men are by Divine Law obliged to communicate under both kinds, and call the <hi>Latins</hi> Hereticks for maintaining the contrary.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. They affirm that Believers when they have attained to years of diſcretion, are not to be forced to communicate every Year
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107630:8"/>at <hi>Eaſter;</hi> but that they are to have liberty of Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. They ſhew no Reſpect, Worſhip, nor Veneration to the Holy Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, even when their Prieſts celebrate, and they carry it to the Sick without Torch-light. Beſides, they keep it in a little Bag and Box, without other Ceremony, than faſtening it to the VVall; whereas they light Lamps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Images.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. They believe that the Hoſt conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on <hi>Holy Thurſday,</hi> is much more efficacious, than thoſe which are conſecrated on ordinary Days.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. They deny that the Sacrament of Marriage is a Bond which cannot be broken. And therefore they accuſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of Errour, for teaching that Marriage cannot be diſſolved in the Caſe of Adultery, and that it is not allowed to marry again in that Caſe. But the <hi>Greeks</hi> teach the contrary, and practiſe it daily.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. They condemn fourth Marriages.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. They ſolemnize not the Feſtivals of the Virgin, Apoſtles and other Saints inſtituted by the Catholick Church and the Fathers, on the ſame Days that the Weſtern Church ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrates them: and beſides that they do it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another manner, they alſo deſpiſe the Feaſts of many very ancient Saints.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. They ſay that the Canon of the <hi>Latin</hi> Maſs ought to be abrogated, as being full of Errours.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. They deny that Uſury is a mortal Sin.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. They deny that Subdeaconſhip is at preſent a ſacred Order.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:107630:9"/>
               <p n="21">XXI. Of all the General Councils that have been celebrated in the Catholick Church by Popes at different times, they admit of none after the ſeventh General Council which is the ſecond of <hi>Nice,</hi> that was called againſt thoſe who rejected Images. The <hi>Greeks</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge none of the reſt, and ſubmit not to their Decrees.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. They deny Auricular Confeſſion to be of Divine Right, pretending it onely to be a Poſitive and Eccleſiatical Conſtitution.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. They ſay that Lay-mens Confeſſions ought to be arbitrary. And therefore amongſt them, Laicks are not conſtrained to confeſs once a year, and they are not excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for neglecting it.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. They pretend that in Confeſſion it is not neceſſary, nor of Divine Right, that men ſhould confeſs all their Sins in particular, nor yet tell all the Circumſtances that alter the nature of a Sin.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. They give the Communion to Laicks, both in Health and Sickneſs, though they have not before confeſſed their Sins to a Prieſt; and that, becauſe they are perſwaded that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is arbitrary, and that Faith is the onely and true Preparation for receiving the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. They ſlight the Vigils of the <hi>Latins,</hi> before the Feſtivals of Our Lord, the Virgin and Apoſtles; aſwell as the Faſts of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-weeks.</hi> Nay on theſe Days they eat Fleſh in contempt of the Latins.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. They accuſe the <hi>Latins</hi> of Hereſie, becauſe they eat fleſh that hath been ſtrangled, and other Meats that are condemned in the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:107630:9"/>
               <p n="28">XXVIII. They deny that ſimple Fornication is a mortal Sin.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. They affirm that it is lawfull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Enemy, and that it is no Sin to doe him Injury.</p>
               <p n="30">XXX. As to Reſtitution they are of the Opinion, that it is not neceſſary to Salvation to reſtore what one has robbed.</p>
               <p n="31">XXXI. In fine, they believe, that he who hath once been a Prieſt, may return again to a Lay-condition.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Opinions that diſtinguiſh the <hi>Greeks</hi> from the <hi>Latins,</hi> if we credit <hi>Caucus,</hi> who attributes that Belief not onely to the <hi>Greeks</hi> of <hi>Corfou,</hi> but alſo to the other <hi>Greeks</hi> who are ſeparated from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <hi>Leo Allatius, Caucus</hi> is an Ignorant, a Slanderer and a Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Judgment, who thought to oblige the Pope by multiplying the Errours of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and hath attributed to all, what he learnt and ſaw in <hi>Corfou.</hi> Nevertheleſs, it is no hard matter to juſtifie <hi>Caucus</hi> in moſt part of the Opinions which he imputes to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> unleſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in what concerns Morality, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption whereof proceeds rather from private Perſons, than an univerſal and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Belief; and it is to be feared that it may be objected to <hi>Allatius,</hi> that he hath ſoftned a great many things in the Opinions of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> through a Deſign of Reconciliation, and to curry Favour with Pope <hi>Urban</hi> VIII. who at that time propoſed to himſelf the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by ſoft and mild ways. In effect, if we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examine the Errours which <hi>Caucus</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107630:10"/>to the Modern <hi>Greeks,</hi> we ſhall find that few Men have more exactly obſerved them. And, indeed, the Pope having enjoined him to doe it, there is no probability that he would have impoſed upon the Pope, in an affair of that importance. Seeing he was not learned in the Divinity of the Ancients, he hath refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all to School-Divinity, and the Deciſions of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which he took to be the Rule according to which he ought to condemn as erroneous, what ever did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thereunto; and in that his ſincerity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the more. For, for a long time he had informed himſelf wherein they agreed with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and wherein they diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, condemning, nevertheleſs, too boldly what ſuited not with the Practice of his Church. But let us conſider more particularly, whether <hi>Caucus</hi> be ſo great a Slanderer, and whether he hath impoſed ſo much on the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> would have the World believe.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Place, as to the re-baptiſing of the <hi>Latins,</hi> it is certain that they have done it in other Places, beſides <hi>Corfou;</hi> and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Enmity they bear towards them, looking upon all their Ceremonies as abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. And for the ſame reaſon they condemn the Maſs of the <hi>Latins,</hi> waſh their Altars af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>Latin</hi> Prieſt hath celebrated on them, as if they had been polluted, and conſider the Unleavened bread conſecrated by the <hi>Latins</hi> as an impure thing. Proofs of this may be had not onely in Catholick Writers, but even in the Oriental Canon Law, and eſpecially in<note n="(1)" place="margin">Reſp. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrii</hi> Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ep.

VII.</hi> apud <hi>Allat.</hi> lib. de interſt.</note> who have written in their favour. Beſides that ſome School Divines have doubted of the Validity of their Baptiſm, and their other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, as might eaſily be proved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that which hath made <hi>Caucus</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> acknowledge not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Confirmation and Extreme Unction, is becauſe he conſidered them with relation to the Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein the former of theſe Sacraments is adminiſtred ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately from Baptiſm; and is at preſent one of the great Functions of Biſhops (to whom it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,) in their Viſitations. The other is never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but to thoſe who are at the Point of Death; from whence that Sacrament hath been called Extreme Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the <hi>Greeks</hi> adminiſter that firſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the ſame time they do Baptiſm, and the Oriental Church hath always retained that Cuſtome, which differs from the Practice of he Weſtern. Beſides, amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107630:11"/>all other Parts of the Eaſt, the Prieſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that Sacrament, as may be ſeen in the Diſſertation which<note n="(1)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc. Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten.</hi> diſſert. de ſacr. Confirm. apud Graecos.</note> 
                  <hi>Holſtenius</hi> made on that Subject, and which was Printed at <hi>Rome</hi> by Order of Cardinal <hi>Franciſco Barbarini.</hi> That Learned Man affirms, that that Practice is ſo ancient in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, that the Power of confirming is become common to Prieſts, as if eſtabliſhed by Law. As for Extreme Unc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Greeks</hi> delay it not, as the <hi>Latins</hi> do, till the ſick Perſon be at the Point of Death, nor do they call that Sacrament Extreme Unc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: On the contrary, the Sick goe to the Church to receive it, when they can conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, and it is adminiſtred to them as often as they are ſick, becauſe they think that St. <hi>James</hi> in his Epiſtle ſpeaks of thoſe that are ſick, and not of ſuch as are at the Point of Death.</p>
               <p>In the third Place, as to Adoration which they render not to the Holy Sacrament after the Conſecration, that ought not neither to be generally underſtood, becauſe it is certain they adore that Sacrament, but onely with relation to the Adoration which the <hi>Latins</hi> pay to the Euchariſt, ſo ſoon as the Prieſt hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced theſe words, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Seeing the <hi>Greeks</hi> place not the Conſecration in theſe words, but in ſome Prayers that come after, it is not to be thought ſtrange, if <hi>Caucus,</hi> who made the Practice of his Church his Rule in judging of the Errours of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> hath ſaid that they adored not the Euchariſt: nay more, when they have conſecrated, which, in their opinion, is done after the invocation of the Holy Ghoſt, they uſe none of that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107630:11"/>adoration which is obſerved in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Church; but they think it enough to adore Jeſus Chriſt who is preſented to them by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the Hoſt after their way, a little before the Communion. However <hi>Caucus</hi> is not to be excuſed in that he took all his meaſures according to the Practice of his own Church, unleſs, probably he had Orders to reform all things according to that Standard.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is of Publick Notoriety, that the Orientals communicate in both kinds, and that they pretend to be warranted in that by the words of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. In that manner the Patriarch <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks in his firſt anſwer to the Divines of <hi>Wittemberg.</hi>

There is, nevertheleſs, this difference, if we will credit <hi>Metrophanes Critopulus,</hi> that the Confeſſour informs himſelf not of the Place where the ſin hath been committed, nor of thoſe who have been concerned in it, nor yet of the manner, becauſe, according to the ſame Authour, that is both needleſs and too curious, which is ſufficient to juſtifie <hi>Caucus.</hi> For as to the Eaſtern Communion, which ought yearly to be received in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, it is a Cuſtome peculiar to that Church.</p>

It is nevertheleſs true, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> diſſolve their Marriages too eaſily, and not in the Caſe of Adultery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; But they ſtill pretend that therein they Conform to the Canon and Civil Laws, which ought to be moderated, becauſe of the too great Liberty they have taken to themſelves.

               <p>Seventhly, it is not to be thought ſtrange, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> eat no fleſh that hath been ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled or ſtrangled, bloud, nor other meats that are not onely forbidden in the Old Teſtament,

               <p>In the Eighth place, as to the Article which concerns the Supremacy of the Pope, it may be thought ſtrange, that <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> ſhould fall ſo foul on <hi>Caucus</hi> in that Point, as if he were one of the greateſt Impoſtours in the World. It is but too true, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> who are not Latiniſed, nay and all the reſt of the Eaſtern Churches, do not at preſent own that Primacy of <hi>Rome</hi> over the other patriarchs, in the manner that it is acknowledged in the Weſtern Church.<note n="(1)" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Ninthly, we may eaſily believe, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> reckon Sub-Deaconſhip amongſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Orders, which are not Sacred, to ſpeak in the Terms of the <hi>Latins,</hi> ſince it is not very long ſince the <hi>Latins</hi> themſelves have made it a ſacred Order.</p>
               <p>In the tenth Place, it may be ſeen in the Books of <hi>Greek</hi> Writers, that to own but ſeven General Councils, is not a thing peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to the <hi>Greeks</hi> of <hi>Corfou.</hi> Nay one would think it a little too much, to oblige them to receive the <hi>Latin</hi> Councils wherein they have had no ſhare, or thoſe others wherein they ſay, they were forced to be preſent, more for the Intereſts of State, than the Concerns of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, as to what concerns Feſtival Days, Faſts, and many other Matters of Diſcipline, it is certain, the <hi>Greek</hi> Church does not agree therein with the <hi>Latin,</hi> and <hi>Caucus</hi> had reaſon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107630:14"/>to ſay, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> admitted them not, nor yet part of the Saints of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which they laugh at when they ſee them in Churches, as may be ſeen in the Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> written by <hi>Syropulus,</hi> where he ſaith,<note n="(1)" place="margin">

                  <hi>When I enter into any Church of the</hi> Latins, <hi>I ſalute none of the Saints whom I ſee, becauſe I know none of them. Nay, I have much adoe to know Jeſus Chriſt there, whom I do not adore neither, becauſe I know not in what manner they repreſent him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think this may be enough to juſtifie <hi>Caucus</hi> in what he attributes to the <hi>Greeks:</hi> and if that Authour hath been pleaſed ſometimes to exaggerate their Errours, and to impoſe upon them, it may alſo be ſaid, that <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> hath not always kept within bounds in making their Defence. I confeſs the way that he hath taken to reunite the two Churches, would be more effectual for reconciling the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, than the Courſe that hath been followed by the Emiſſaries who have encreaſed their Errours, and continue to doe ſo daily, inſtead of leſſening them: but for all that, we may know the true Sentiments of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> if we can but lay aſide our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Prejudices, and diſtinguiſh thoſe who are Latiniſed, from thoſe that are not.</p>
               <p>We forgot to obſerve their Belief as to Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Hell and Paradiſe.<note n="(2)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Caucus,</hi> ib. ac ſupra.</note> 
                  <hi>Caucus</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Writers does affirm, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> deny Purgatory, and that notwithſtanding they pray for the Dead: which is to be underſtood with relation to the Opinion of the <hi>Latins,</hi> who commonly eſtabliſh a Place of Purgatory, and a Fire which torments Souls.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107630:14"/>But the <hi>Greeks</hi> deny both, though they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a certain State of Purgatory; and therefore they pray to God for the Dead. It is certain that Prayers for the Dead have been appointed in the Church in the very firſt ages, as appears by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and the Ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of the Fathers, aſwell as by the moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Liturgies. Perhaps the Church took that Ceremony from the <hi>Jews,</hi> who likewiſe pray to God for the Dead; which was a Cuſtome practiſed in the Synagogues long before the Birth of Chriſtianity, and is to be found prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed at that time when the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the Dominion of the <hi>Grecians.</hi> There is this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, nevertheleſs, betwixt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Latins,</hi> as to their praying for the Dead, that the latter have explained themſelves more fully; whereas the former, and all the other Orientals, have continued in more General Terms. The <hi>Latins,</hi> however, in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the Dead at Maſs, retain the Ancient form, which agrees pretty well with what the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe of Hell, Purgatory and Paradiſe. This is the manner of praying for the Dead in the Maſs of the <hi>Latins. Domine Jeſu Chriſte, libera animas omnium fidelium defunctorum de poenis inferni &amp; de profundo lacu: libera eas de ore I eonis, ne abſorbeat eas Tartarus, ne cadant in obſcurum,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe words ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Opinion of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Chriſtians of the Eaſt, for they ſuppoſe but one Place, which is Hell, where the Souls are detained as in a dark Priſon, and they pray that the Souls may paſs from that obſcure Place, to a Place of Light and Reſt, which is Paradiſe: and this exactly agrees with the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107630:15"/>Prayer that the Prieſt ſays at the Maſs which is called <hi>in die obitus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to what concerns Hell, we ſhall not ſpeak here of the Opinion of <hi>Origen,</hi> who hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs been followed by ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours; we ſhall onely mention what is moſt generally approved by them. When they pray that God would deliver Souls out of Hell, that is to be underſtood of the State of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; I mean, that in that obſcure Priſon which they call Hell, there are two ſorts of Souls; one ſort whoſe Sins are not ſo enormous as to be condemned for them to Eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment there; and another who are really condemned to Hell, there to abide for ever. Of theſe laſt it may be ſaid, that <hi>in inferno nulla eſt redemptio;</hi> whereas in reſpect of the firſt ſort of Souls, it may be ſaid, that <hi>in inferno eſt redemptio.</hi> This may ſerve to explain the Liturgies and Books of the New <hi>Greeks,</hi> which ſeem to ſuppoſe that the Souls ſhall not remain in Hell for ever, and that ſo the Puniſhment of the damned is not Eternal. If we take this Rule along with us, we may have an eaſie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all the Prayers that are ſaid for the Dead in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>As to Paradiſe, the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are in this perſwaſion, that Souls enjoy not Eternal Bliſs, and that they are not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the Pains of Hell, before they receive Sentence from God at the laſt day of Univerſal Judgment. And therefore according to the Sentiment of the <hi>Greeks</hi> we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh two Paradiſes. The firſt is that Place of Light and Reſt, mentioned in their Prayers and Liturgy, where the Souls of the Bleſſed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107630:15"/>repoſe expecting the laſt Judgment. That Place is called in the publick Office, that is ſaid for the Dead, Paradiſe, Light, Life, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſome, the Land of the Living, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond Paradiſe is that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Bliſs which they ſhall enjoy in heaven after the Univerſal Judgment; and they think that Opinion to be more agreeable to the Texts of Holy Scripture, than that of the <hi>Latins:</hi> for it ſhall not be, ſay they, but at that day, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who will come in quality of Judge, ſhall ſay to the Elect,<note n="(1)" place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the World,</hi> &amp;c. They pretend that the Opinion of the <hi>Latins</hi> concerning Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe and Hell before the laſt day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not founded on Antiquity. Beſides, we may obſerve, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> have not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized ſo much upon the Light of the Glory of the Bleſſed, as moſt of the <hi>Latine</hi> Divines have done, who have ſpoken of it with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nicety. Nay, there are ſome who affirm, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> Fathers deny, that the Angels and Bleſſed ſee the Eſſence of God in Heaven; relying upon theſe words of <hi>Theodoret,</hi>
                  <note n="(2)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Theod.</hi> Dial. immut.</note> 
                  <hi>The Angels ſee not the Divine Eſſence, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all things, and cannot be comprehended, nor known, but they ſee a certain ſpecies which is proportionate to their Nature.</hi> And this they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm alſo by the Teſtimony of many Fathers.</p>
               <p>There remains ſomewhat to be ſaid of the Morals, Diſcipline, and Ceremonies of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> As to their Morality, ſeeing they have the ſame Principles as the <hi>Latius</hi> have, it cannot be much different from theirs; unleſs it be, that wanting the uſe of School Divinity, they are not ſo great Metaphyſicians as the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107630:16"/>
                  <hi>Latins;</hi> wherein they are not to be blamed, when they mingle no Logick nor Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks in their Books of Morality, if you except ſome <hi>Greeks</hi> who have ſtudied in the Schools of <hi>Italy,</hi> or have read the Books of the <hi>Latins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be, notwithſtanding, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Chriſtians of the Eaſt do not walk up to the ſtrictneſs of the Rules of Morality, becauſe of the ſad condition to which they are at preſent reduced. Their Church-men are accuſed of Simony, becauſe the Biſhops ſell Orders; and the Prieſts the Adminiſtration of Sacraments: but if matters be throughly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, perhaps they are not ſo blameable as people think. There is a neceſſity that they live by their Calling; and ſeeing they have no Benefices, as they are at preſent eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> why are they not to be allowed to take money for the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacraments? There is no fault found with the Cuſtome that is introduced into the Weſt, of taking money for Maſſes, Confeſſions, and many other things; and ſhall a poor <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas</hi> be accuſed of Simony, for being paid for an Abſolution that he giveth, and for having rated it according to the nature of the Sin? Nor do we think it ſtrange, neither, that certain Sins are rated at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe we are accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to the practice. Will the new diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Right and Eccleſiaſtical Right, that ſome Divines and Canoniſts have invented in theſe laſt Ages, put the Pope without the reach of Simony; and ſhall not that extreme neceſſity to which the Patriarch and <hi>Greeks</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are reduced render them at all excuſable before God and Man, in that they take money
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107630:16"/>for Ordinations? It is not that I would excuſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> in all things: for it is certain they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times take too much Liberty to themſelves, and that they are not carefull enough to ſquare their Conſciences according to the Rules of Chriſtian Morality. But the Ignorance and Poverty wherein they are at preſent, are the cauſe of their Diſorders, which nevertheleſs the vertuous Men amongſt them prevent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they can, as the Patriarch <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who openly<note n="(1)" place="margin">

               <p>As to Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, they conform not in all things to the Preſcript of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. For inſtance, they obſerve not exactly the Age that is required for Prieſthood and Epiſcopacy; beſides, they mind but very little the Intervals, and take ſeveral Orders together at one time. The Election of their Patriarch is not always Canonical; for he that gives moſt to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> is commonly preferred before the reſt: And therefore there are many times ſeveral that take the Title of Patriarch. Monſieur <hi>de Nointel</hi> Ambaſſadour for the <hi>French</hi> King at the Port<note n="(2)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Monſieur Noint.</hi> Tom. <hi>3.</hi> de la Perpet.</note> takes notice of four Patriarchs alive in the Year 1671. The <hi>Greeks</hi> are ambitious, and therefore they take all courſes to riſe to that Dignity; which is the Cauſe of great Troubles in that Church.</p>
               <p>Beſides the money that the Patriarch Elect gives to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> for Letters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, he is alſo obliged to buy the Voices
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107630:17"/>of the Biſhops who elect him: and every one upon that Occaſion is willing to make the moſt of his Voice. But, on the other hand, the Patriarch knows very well how to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amends, when he makes any Biſhop: which the Biſhops alſo doe in regard of their <hi>Papas,</hi> to whom they ſell Orders and Cures as dear as poſſibly they can; and all, at length, falls upon the poor People, who pay very dear for the Adminiſtration of Sacraments; and that's the reaſon they goe but ſeldom to them.</p>
               <p>The Patriarch and Biſhops are not married; but the Prieſts marry before their Ordination: and that Practice which is General over all the <hi>Levant</hi> is ancient. I do not here examine whether it be agreeable to the Primitive Canons of the Church, or a Deviation for the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Canons.

                  </gap>, live according as they pleaſe themſelves, as their Name does import. And therefore before they take the Habit, they give ſome money for a Cell, and ſome other Neceſſaries of the Monaſtery. The Yeoman of the Cellar or Butler furniſhes them with Bread and Wine as he does the reſt: and ſo being exempted from the Duties of the Monaſtery, they mind their own buſineſs. Theſe laſt leave by Will what they poſſeſs, aſwell within as without the Monaſtery, to their Servant or Companion, whom they call Diſciple, and whom they have choſen from among the Monks to aſſiſt them in their occaſions. This Man after the Death of the other, by his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement improves the goods that he hath
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107630:18"/>inherited, and leaves by Will what he hath purchaſed, to him whom he hath choſen for his Companion: the reſt of the goods which he poſſeſſed, that is to ſay, what his Maſter left him when he died, falls to the Monaſtery, which afterwards ſells them to thoſe that pleaſe to purchaſe. Nevertheleſs amongſt theſe laſt Monks there are ſome ſo miſerably poor, that having nothing to purchaſe a piece of Land with, are obliged to work and labour for the Monaſtery, and to apply themſelves to the baſeſt employments. Theſe do all for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Convent, and therefore the Convent ſupplies them with Neceſſaries; and if they have any ſpare time after their work is done, they employ it in Prayers.</p>
               <p>There is a third Order of theſe Monks, who goe by the Name of <hi>Anchorites.</hi> Theſe not being able to work, nor ſupport the other Duties of the Monaſtery, have, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, a mind to live in the repoſe of ſolitude. They buy a Cell out of the Monaſtery, with a little piece of Land on which they may live, and never goe to the Monaſtery but on Holy days, to aſſiſt at the Office; after which they return to their Cells, where they mind their own Affairs, having no hours appointed them for Prayers. There are, nevertheleſs, ſome of theſe <hi>Anchorites</hi> who have left their Monaſtery with the Conſent of their Abbot, that they may lead a more retired life, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves more to Meditation and Prayer. The Monaſtery ſends them once a month Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to live on, becauſe they poſſeſs neither Lands nor Vineyards: but thoſe who will not depend upon the Abbot, hire ſome Vineyard
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107630:19"/>near to their Cell, of which they eat the Grapes; others live on Cherries or ſuch like Fruit. They alſo ſow Beans in the Seaſon of the year; and ſome gain their living by tranſcribing Books.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Monks, there are Nuns alſo who live in Community, and are ſhut up in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries under the Inſtitution of St. <hi>Baſil.</hi> They are no leſs ſtrict than the Monks, as to Faſting, Praying and the other Offices of the Monaſtick Life. They chuſe one of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt and moſt virtuous of their Community to ſupply the place of Abbeſs; and theſe Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſes are the ſame with them, as the Abbots are with the Monks. Nevertheleſs, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of Women depends always on an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, who aſſigns them one of the oldeſt and moſt virtuous Monks to confeſs and adminiſter the Sacraments to them. This Monk lives near their Monaſtery, that he may be at hand to aſſiſt them readily in their occaſions. He ſays likewiſe Maſs for them; and orders the other Offices.</p>
               <p>Theſe Nuns wear all the ſame Habit, and a Cloak of the ſame colour. Their Arms and Hands are covered to their Fingers ends; and their Habit is of plain Woollen Cloth. Their Heads, beſides, are ſhaven, and every one hath a Cell apart where they lodge conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. The richer ſort have a Maid; and ſometimes they bring up in their Houſes young Girles, whom they bring up in the Duties of Piety and Devotion. When they have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their ordinary Duties, they work with their Needle; and the <hi>Turks</hi> who bear a reſpect towards theſe Nuns, come to their Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107630:19"/>to buy Girdles of their making. The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſes willingly open the Doors of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent to the <hi>Turks</hi> who come to buy the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of theſe good Nuns, who return to their Appartment ſo ſoon as they have ſold their Wares.</p>
               <p>I have read a Manuſcript Relation, that ſpeaks not ſo much to the advantage of theſe Nuns. The Authour of that Relation obſerves that the Nuns called <hi>Caloyeres,</hi> who live at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> are Widows, ſome of which have had ſeveral Husbands, and that they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace not that Profeſſion, but when they are well ſtricken in years: Then he adds, that they make no Vows, that all their Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſts in wearing a Black Veil upon their Head, and declaring that they will Marry no more; that, after all, they live moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at home, where they mind their Houſe-wifery, their Children and Relations. He confeſſes, nevertheleſs, that there are ſome of them who live in Community, but that theſe are more miſerable than the former: that both go about whereſoever they pleaſe: and that, in fine, they have more Liberty under that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Habit, than they had before.</p>
               <p>The Faſts of the <hi>Greeks</hi> are different enough from thoſe of the <hi>Latins:</hi> for the Faſts of the latter would be Feſtival Days, and Days of good Cheer amongſt the Orientals, in regard they not onely abſtain from Fleſh, and all that comes from it, as Butter and Cheeſe; but they eat not ſo much as Fiſh, contenting themſelves with Fruits and Pulſe, with ſome ſmall portion of Oil, and drink very little Wine. The Monks are more ſtrict in their Faſting, becauſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107630:20"/>they never taſte Wine nor Oil, unleſs on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdays and Sundays. Yet the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> are allowed to eat Fiſh, becauſe they have neither Wine nor Oil. Wedneſdays and Fridays they abſtain from Fleſh, and all that comes of it; but on theſe days they are allowed to eat Fiſh. I ſhall ſay nothing of their Lent, nor private Faſts; onely muſt obſerve that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Eaſtern Nations exceedingly blame the Saturdays Faſt of the <hi>Latins,</hi> becauſe they ſay, that Day is a Feſtival as well as Sunday; which they prove by the Ancient Canons and the practice of the firſt Ages. In fine, as to their Ceremonies, it may be ſaid in general, that no Nation in Chriſtendom hath ſo many. Their Euchology or Ritual, with the Notes of <hi>P. Goar,</hi> may be conſulted as to that point. So ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive is the Worſhip they render to Images, that in a Manuſcript which I have read con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Errours of the <hi>Latins,</hi> they upbraid them<note n="(1)" place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and in <hi>Latin, Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> That Adoration is not performed by Kneeling, Bowing, or any other Geſture of Body, but onely by kiſſing the Image. If it be the Image of our Lord, they commonly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107630:20"/>kiſs the Feet: if an Image of the Virgin, they kiſs the Hands: and in a word, if it be the Image of ſome Saint they kiſs the Face.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many other Ceremonies, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> obſerve in the Adoration of their Images, have been much augmented ſince the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> where the Patrons of Images obtained a great Victory over the <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noclaſts.</hi> And it is chiefly ſince that time that the <hi>Greeks</hi> have publiſhed the Miraculous Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of their Images, of which their Books are full: and as if they had not had enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves at home, they have ſearched at <hi>Rome</hi> and other places for Miracles that have been wrought by virtue of Images.</p>
               <p>After all, the <hi>Greeks</hi> ground moſt of their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies upon their Traditions. They take no great care to examine, whether theſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions be Ancient, or not. It is enough that they are in practice, to make them paſs for Apoſtolical. And ſeeing there are but few able Men amongſt them, they are incapable of Judging whether or no their Traditions be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded on Antiquity. One of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which hath moſt aſtoniſhed the <hi>Latins,</hi> is that which they obſerve with great Pomp in reſpect of the Myſteries, when they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the little Altar, which they call the Altar of <hi>Propoſition;</hi> and that before the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, which is ſurprizing, they render Extraordinary Honours to the Bread and Wine before they are conſecrated, and onely barely bleſſed. Amongſt their Ceremonies which are onely grounded on Tradition, but Apoſtolical, may be reckoned moſt part of their Sacraments: becauſe, as we have obſerved before, they do
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107630:21"/>not believe that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Authour of them. All theſe Sacraments are accompanied with a great many Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, becauſe they are perſwaded, that too much external reſpect cannot be given to Holy things. And therefore they Celebrate their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy and other Offices with far greater Pomp, than the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth. They have beſides a great many Books of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but no Breviaries for the uſe of private Perſons, as the <hi>Latins</hi> have; becauſe, ſay they, the Office ought to be ſaid publickly in the Church, and not privately in a Chamber.<note n="(1)" place="margin">Jan. Nic. Erythr. <hi>in</hi> Pinacoth.</note> 
                  <hi>Francis Arcudius</hi> having thought fit to make a kind of Breviary for the uſe of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which he compiled out of their Books of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, met not with the Satisfaction that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to himſelf: for the <hi>Greeks</hi> deſpiſe that Breviary, and there are none but the Monks of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> of the Monaſtery of <hi>Crypta Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> Fifteen Miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> who uſe it in their Travels.</p>
               <p>We ſhall not inſiſt longer on the Ceremonies of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> for it requires a whole Volume to deſcribe them fully. Moſt part of theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies have a Myſtical Senſe, if we will Credit ſome of their Doctors who have written on that Subject. But all Men know, that there is nothing worſe grounded than that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and Allegorical Divinity. I could rather have wiſhed that I could have repreſented here in Abridgement the Singing and Muſick of the great Church of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> but beſides that that would be too tedious, there would be need alſo of a great many Figures.

               <p>(*) THough this Queſtion hath been largely handled by Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> in his Books a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> yet it ſtill lies under great difficulties; Nay there are a great many, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially amongſt the Proteſtants, who do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together credit the great number of Atteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons produced by that Doctour in his Book of the <hi>Perpetuity;</hi> becauſe, ſay they, he gives one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Vulgar Tranſlation of all theſe Atteſtations, without publiſhing the Originals; and it may be they have been ill Tranſlated: beſides that, ſay the ſame Proteſtants, ſome things are to be found in theſe Teſtimonies, which are no ways the Belief of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and which, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent give occaſion to doubt of the Sincerity of theſe Records. Wherefore ſome Jeſuits have had a deſign of publiſhing more Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Atteſtations, and in the ſame Languages they have been made in: which will certainly be of great uſe. However, till that be done, I ſhall here produce ſome Proofs of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> concerning Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107630:22"/>which, in my Opinion, ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all the Atteſtations that can be brought from the <hi>Levant;</hi> becauſe the Jeſuits will not onely be ſuſpected by Proteſtants, but they will not fail alſo to ſay, that theſe Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations have been gain'd by artifice, and that the modern <hi>Greeks</hi> may be made to doe any thing for Money: whereas Teſtimonies taken out of Books that have been compoſed by <hi>Greeks</hi> before theſe Diſputes, are Proofs that cannot be excepted againſt. Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who ſaw the Force of ſuch Proofs, objected to Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> the Authority of <hi>Gabriel</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> who in formal Termes aſſerts Tranſubſtantiation, in the ſame manner as the <hi>Latins</hi> do. But ſeeing he had not the Book of that Authour, he took it altogether upon the Teſtimony of Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> who cited it in his Book of the Euchariſt; from whence Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> hath taken occaſion to reject that Authority, as being ſuſpect, in as much as the Cardinal, who mentions commonly the <hi>Greek</hi> words of the Authours whom he cites, related onely in <hi>French</hi> the Teſtimony of that Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. <hi>Monſieur Claude</hi> eluded alſo the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the ſame <hi>Gabriel</hi> cited in <hi>Greek</hi> by <hi>Arcudius,</hi> pretending that he had not Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the words of that <hi>Greek</hi> Authour, but that he had enlarged them by paraphraſing them after his way. In this manner did that Miniſter elude many other Proofs of Fact by mere Subtilties, untill Father <hi>Simon</hi> cauſed the Works of <hi>Gabriel</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to be printed in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> with many other Pieces ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Good Originals, which cannot be called in Queſtion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrillus Lucaris,</hi> who is become ſo famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> was born in <hi>Crete,</hi> and entred very young into the ſervice of <hi>Meletius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who was alſo of <hi>Crete,</hi> and who having found him to be a Man of Parts, and Studious, ordained him Prieſt. After that, he went to <hi>Padua</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his Studies; from whence returning to <hi>Alexandria, Meletius</hi> made him Head of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, and ſent him into <hi>Walachia:</hi> which gave him occaſion in paſſing through <hi>Germany,</hi> to have Conferences with the Proteſtants of that Countrey, underſtanding the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue and School Divinity excellently well. Being come back from his Commiſſion, he made uſe of the Money that he had gathered
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107630:30"/>for the Neceſſary occaſions of the Patriarch; to get himſelf choſen Patriarch: and being raiſed to that Dignity, he entertained his Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Proteſtants, employing for that purpoſe <hi>Metrophanes Critopulus,</hi> who has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton a Book concerning the belief of his Church, Printed at <hi>Helmſtadt.</hi> This <hi>Metrophanes</hi> went in Name of his Patriarch into <hi>England,</hi> and over a good part of <hi>Germany,</hi> where he informed himſelf, as exactly as he could, of the State of the Proteſtants, whereof he made a report to <hi>Cyrill</hi> whom he found at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he was caſting about how he might get into the Patriarchate of that Church. This made him contract a Friendſhip with the Ambaſſadours of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> then at the Port, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with the latter, who proved afterward uſefull to him for advancing his Affairs. <hi>Cyrill</hi> being as yet but a Monk, had got a particular acquaintance with the <hi>Heer Cornelius Haga,</hi> who then travelled in the <hi>Levant,</hi> and who being afterward come back to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in Quality of Envoy from the States General, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his Ancient Acquaintance with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> who at that time was Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and who entreated him to ſend for ſome Books of the Proteſtant Divines, profeſſing to have ſome liking of their Opinions. This being a deſire which the <hi>Heer Haga</hi> could not refuſe, gave advice of it to his Maſters, who failed not preſently to ſend as many Books to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> as were ſufficient to have corrupted all <hi>Greece,</hi> had they been written in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Countrey. It was impoſſible but that the affairs of <hi>Cyrill</hi> muſt make a Noiſe, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially having the Jeſuits of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107630:31"/>Enemies, who in every thing oppoſed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, publiſhing aloud that he was a Heretick; and gave advice of it to the Jeſuits of <hi>Paris,</hi> that the King might be informed of the ſame. The matter was repreſented to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the States at <hi>Paris,</hi> who wrote about it to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> From that time forward <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill</hi> obſerved no ſuch meaſures with the Jeſuits as he had done before. He made no Scruple to give the <hi>Heer Haga</hi> a Confeſſion of Faith writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Latin</hi> with his own Hand, which ſome time after he turned into <hi>Greek.</hi> It is the ſame Confeſſion which was Printed at <hi>Geneva</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and which made the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants ſay, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church agreed with them in the chief points of their belief; eſpecially as to the matter of the Euchariſt. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,</hi> in the mean time, who had a ſtrong Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt the Jeſuits and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> was choſen Patriarch, and for the ſpace of five or ſix Months after, made nothing appear in his Actions that might give any ſign of Defection from the Religion of his fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But ſeeing he had the Jeſuits for Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he thought himſelf obliged to declare for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> that he might be ſeconded by them; he engaged alſo in his party a conſiderable Number of Biſhops and Churchmen, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his opinions, and were in the ſame Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition as he was, to introduce Novelties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. But they were not the Stronger, becauſe the Jeſuits, who have a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> where they teach the Youth <hi>Gratis,</hi> eaſily gained the People, who made an Inſurrection againſt <hi>Cyrill.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> held an Aſſembly in the year 1622. wherein
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107630:31"/>he was depoſed from his Patriarchate, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes.</hi> Another Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch was choſen in his Place, who by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſubmitted himſelf to the court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that had forwarded his Election. But ſeeing <hi>Cyrill</hi> ſtill entertained a Party in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſupplied him with great Summs of Money, it was not long before he was reſtored to his Patriarchate. Then it was that he revenged himſelf on the Jeſuits, and thoſe who had eſpouſed the Intereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that <hi>Calviniſm</hi> reigned at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> This brought great Diſorders into that Church, for <hi>Cyrill</hi> ſet every thing to ſale, that he might pay the Money which he had borrowed of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The Jeſuits and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> finding that <hi>Cyrill</hi> had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely got the better on't, endeavoured to gain him, by propoſing terms of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and repreſenting to him the danger of his Church, if he continued thoſe Intrigues with the <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> He ſeemed to be very willing to embrace an accommodation: but ſeeing he ſtill continued his Practices with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> made a freſh attempt to turn him out of his Chair: which ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but for a very ſhort time, becauſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> Money ſoon recalled him again to his Patriarchate. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> doubling their efforts againſt <hi>Cyrill,</hi> ſent one to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> in Quality of Vicar of the Patriarch, for maintaining the Orthodox Faith in that Church, which ſeemed to be upon the brink of Ruine. <hi>Cyrill</hi>'s Party failed not to lay hold on that occaſion, to render the Jeſuits and their Party odious to the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107630:32"/>jealous of that Envoy of <hi>Rome:</hi> Inſomuch that he was very ill uſed by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Cyrill</hi> cruelly revenged himſelf on all the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whom he thought to be his Enemies. Nevertheleſs he rendered himſelf ſo odious by his great vexations, and had ſo powerfull a Party, as the Jeſuits of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſeconded by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to deal with, that he at length fell, and was ſtrangled by expreſs Orders from the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Hiſtory of the Patriarch <hi>Cyrillus Lucaris,</hi> in whoſe Name the <hi>Huguenots</hi> Printed a Confeſſion of Faith, boaſting that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in Opinions with the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. But with the glance of an Eye one may judge, what kind of a Confeſſion of Faith it is. It is true it was written by a Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with the Title of, The Belief of the Eaſtern Church; but it was not written in name of that Church, nor hath it any publick approbation. <hi>Cyrill</hi> gave it privately to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadour, whoſe aſſiſtance he needed to defend him againſt the Jeſuits of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> That work of <hi>Cyrill</hi>'s is much like the Book that is ſaid to have been made by <hi>William Poſtel</hi> for a Nun, whom he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that he might ſqueeze a little Money from her, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> came into the world onely for Men, and that ſhe Lady <hi>Jean</hi> was to be the Meſſieſs of the Women. There is as much likelyhood of truth in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>Cyrill</hi>'s, that went under the name of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, as there is in the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of that famous <hi>Normand William Poſtel:</hi> and I wonder that Proteſtants ſhould ſtill dare to object to Catholicks that pretended
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107630:32"/>Confeſſion. <hi>Grotius</hi> gave a better Judgment of it in a Book that he publiſhed ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Confeſſion came abroad in the word, wherein he frankly ſays,<note n="(1)" place="margin">Nuper Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopoli Cyrillus ſine Patriarchis, ſine Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litis, ſine Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copis novum nobis propina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit Symbolum. <hi>Grot.</hi> de Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</note> that <hi>Cyrill</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a new Symbol, without the aſſiſtance of any Patriarchs, Archbiſhops or Biſhops. Now, after all, I have related the Hiſtory of this <hi>Cyrill</hi> with all the exactneſs I could, without any regard to what the <hi>Dutch</hi> have written of him, nor to what <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> hath ſaid, who alſo exceeds the bounds of moderation. I have ſcarcely mentioned any thing but what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon by both the oppoſite Parties.</p>
               <p>Beſides <hi>Cyrill,</hi> there are other <hi>Greeks</hi> of leſs note, who have written in favour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and amongſt others one <hi>Gergan</hi> a Biſhop, who hath publiſhed a Catechiſm, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he openly denies Tranſubſtantiation, but with this difference from <hi>Cyrill,</hi> that he follows not the Confeſſion of <hi>Geneva,</hi> but that of <hi>Ausbourg.</hi> If we compare the Doctrine of this Catechiſm with that of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, we ſhall find it almoſt different in every Point, that it may be accommodated to the Sentiments of Proteſtants: as when it ſaith that Scripture alone is ſufficient, without the help of Tradition to prove the Articles of our Creed; That the Scripture is plain and clear as to the Points of Faith, and that Scripture ought to be interpreted by Scripture.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> adds to all theſe <hi>Greek Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> the Teſtimony of one <hi>Meletius</hi> Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in an anſwer he made about thirty Years agoe to the Divines of <hi>Leyden,</hi> as to ſeveral Queſtions that had been put to him.

I procured by means of one of Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Friends, whom he could not deny, a Copy of that anſwer; and having read it, I found that Father <hi>Simon</hi>'s conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was a real truth. For <hi>Meletius,</hi> who in that Letter takes the Title of Archbiſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> not onely denies Tranſubſtantiation, but alſo the Honour that is rendered to the Virgin and Saints, and many other Points which all Men do agree the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe.

And this I take to be the plain and natural reaſon of the omiſſion of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Books. To which we may add, that if the Argument of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> were conſequential, it would in the ſame manner prove that the <hi>Latins</hi> believe not Tranſubſtantiation, becauſe that word
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107630:34"/>is not to be found neither in their Maſs nor Symbols. But let us, at length, come to the laſt objection.</p>
               <p>The Symbols of Bread and Wine are called Antitypes or Figures, even after the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Liturgy of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> whence it is inferred, that in that they differ very much from the Belief of the <hi>Latins.</hi> But it ſeems Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> is not very Learned in the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſince he ſays generally, that they call the Symbols Antitypes, even after the Conſecration. There is not a <hi>Greek</hi> at preſent, nor hath there been for theſe nine Hundred Years any of that opinion. It is certain all the Modern <hi>Greeks</hi> pretend, that the Conſecration is not performed till after the Prayer which they call the Invocation of the Holy Ghoſt, which Prayer in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy follows the words, that call the Sacred Symbols Antitypes. <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who was Head of the Party againſt the <hi>Latins</hi> in the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> makes uſe of that Place of the Liturgy, to prove that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration conſiſts not in theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> but in the Prayer or Benediction of the Prieſt made afterward by invocating the Holy Ghoſt. That zealous Champion for the Faith of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> grounds his aſſertion chiefly on this, that St. <hi>Baſil</hi> in his Liturgy calls the Symbols<note n="(1)" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>Antitypes</hi> could not otherways be underſtood in the Liturgy of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> that for the Gifts before the Conſecration, and that after the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were called the real Body and Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt. St. <hi>John Damaſcene, Nicephorus</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and, in a word, all the Defenders of Image-worſhip, are of that Judgment, and object it to the <hi>Iconoclaſts</hi> as a ſtrong Argument to authoriſe the Honour paid to Images, ſince Honours, ſay they, are rendered to the Holy Gifts, whilſt they are as yet but Antitypes, or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, before the Conſecration. Since that time all the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſpeak the ſame Language. They, however, who have any knowledge of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, are obliged to confeſs, that the Biſhops of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> were miſtaken in matter of fact, and that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers gave the Name of Antitypes to the Symbols, even after their Conſecration, not thinking that that word ſignified any thing contrary to the real preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt. It appears manifeſtly by the Diſpute, that was betwixt the <hi>Iconoclaſts</hi> and the Patrons of Images, that there was no Difficulty betwixt them concerning the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which both Parties acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be in the Euchariſt after the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107630:35"/>They differed onely in this, to wit, whether after the Conſecration, the Bread ought ſtill to be called an Antitype. The <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noclaſts</hi> affirmed it, and had Antiquity on their ſide, the Defenders of Images denied it, and fell into a miſtake of a matter of fact, which did not the leaſt prejudice the Affair in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. So that what way ſoever the word Antitype be interpreted, Proteſtants can draw no conſequence from it againſt the Belief of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>

               <p>THough this Adoration be a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of Tranſubſtantiation, yet there are ſome Proteſtants, who freely confeſs that the <hi>Greeks</hi> are much of the ſame Judgment with the <hi>Latins</hi> as to the Matter of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation; but they deny that they adore Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the Conſecrated Symbols, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that their Worſhip terminates on Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven. They are confirmed in this Opinion chiefly, becauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the Celebration of their Liturgy, render not much Honour to the Sacred Symbols after their Conſecration, as the <hi>Latin</hi> Church doth. But we are not always to paſs a Judgment on
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107630:36"/>things by the External Worſhip; and in that many Emiſſaries have been miſtaken, aſwell as Proteſtants, when they would meaſure the Orientals by the Practice and Cuſtome of their own Church. It is certain, we ſhew greater Reſpect and Veneration to Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt, than we did before the time of the <hi>Berengarians,</hi> nay and before the time of the Proteſtants too, at leaſt in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the exteriour. It is chiefly but ſince the Birth of <hi>Neſtorianiſm,</hi> that greateſt Reſpect has been ſhewn to the Virgin. Beſides, the <hi>Greek</hi> Church never rendered ſuch exceſſive Honours to Images, but ſince the <hi>Iconoclaſts</hi> were ſo incenſed againſt them.<note place="margin">[*]</note> [*] It muſt not, therefore, be ſaid, that before that time no Honour was rendered neither to the Virgin nor Images. The caſe is the ſame with the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Eaſtern Chriſtians, who have continued in their Ancient ſimplicity, becauſe they have not had the ſame reaſons as the <hi>Latins</hi> had to come out of it; and if they be accuſed that they adore not the symbols, the Ancients are likewiſe to be accuſed for not having adored them, becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be found neither in their Books nor Liturgies that comes near the External Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of our times. In this manner we are to underſtand the words of <hi>Caucus,</hi> when he affirms that no Nation under the Sun renders leſs Honour to the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt than the <hi>Greeks</hi> do; and it is not to be denied but that he goes too far in what he relates, comparing them to ſome Reformers of the Weſt. But after all, we cannot make a better Judgment of the Practice of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107630:41"/>and Joy: if it be the Soul of a wicked Man, it is put into an obſcure Place; if that Perſon dye in the Act of Repentance, it is ſent for a time into the Place of Horrour and Obſcurity, whence it is afterwards conveyed into the Place of Joy; and all expect the day of General Judgment, becauſe they abſolutely deny that the Souls ſee God before that time. The <hi>Ibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> beſides, according to the ſame Authour, believe that Infidels are onely judged in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Judgment, and not at the General Judgment. They ground themſelves upon theſe words of the Goſpel,<note n="(1)" place="margin">John. 3.</note>

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I think that that Belief which comes near to that of <hi>Origen,</hi> and which ſeems to have been followed by ſome new <hi>Greeks,</hi> is not the real Belief of the <hi>Iberians,</hi> who exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Faith of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; but that which hath given occaſion of imputing it to them, is becauſe they own but one Place after Death where they put the Souls of the Damned, and thoſe who are thought to be in Purgatory. Now ſeeing they pray indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for all the Souls which are ſhut up in that Place which they call Hell, that God would deliver them from the Pains of Hell, and that he would remove them from that obſcure Priſon to the Place of Light and Joy which is Paradiſe; it hath eaſily been inferred from thence, that they believed not Hell to be Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107630:42"/>which is to be underſtood with Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and in regard of ſome Souls onely who endure their Purgatory in that Place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iberians</hi> agree alſo with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as to their Opinion of Confeſſion, and ſpeak of it after the ſame manner. They work on the moſt ſolemn Holy-days, even on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-day: but that is not contrary to the Practice of the firſt Ages. This is their way of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. In the firſt Place the Prieſt reads a great many Prayers over the Child; and when he comes to the words wherein we make the Form of Baptiſm to conſiſt, he does not ſtop, but reads on, without Baptiſing the Child at that time: then ſo ſoon as he hath done rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the Child is ſtript, and is at length bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by the Godfather, and not by the Prieſt; which is done without pronouncing other words, than thoſe that were pronounced ſome time before. They are not very preſſing to receive Baptiſm; and they rebaptiſe thoſe who return again to the Faith after Apoſtaſie. The Prieſt alone, amongſt them, is the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Baptiſm.<note n="(1)" place="margin">In periculo obitûs ſi deſit ſacerdos, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fans non bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizatur.</note> So that for want of a Prieſt the Child muſt dye without Baptiſm; and ſome of their Doctours are of opinion, that in that caſe the Baptiſm of the Mother is ſufficient to ſave the Child. With Baptiſm they adminiſter to Children Confirmation, and the Euchariſt. They confeſs for the firſt time, when they marry: which they doe alſo when they are at the Point of Death; but their Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made in three or four words. If a Prieſt fall into any uncleanneſs which he confeſſes, the Confeſſour deprives him of the Power of celebrating Maſs. And therefore the Prieſts,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107630:42"/>have a care not to confeſs thoſe Kinds of Sins.<note n="(1)" place="margin">Pueris mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientibus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtiam.</note> They give the Communion to Children when they are a dying, and thoſe that are come to Age receive it but ſeldom. The Prince forces the Churchmen, and even the Biſhops to goe to the Wars: and when they return home again, they celebrate Maſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Diſpenſation for their irregularity. They are of the Opinion, that no more than one Maſs ſhould be ſaid in one Day upon one Altar and in one Church. They conſecrate in Chalices of Wood,<note n="(2)" place="margin">Euchariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am deferunt ad infirmos maxima cum irreverentia, ſine comitatu &amp; luminibus.</note> And they carry the Sacrament to the Sick with great irreverence, without light or attendance. On ſome Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days the prieſts together aſſiſt at the Maſs of the Biſhop, who gives them the Sacrament in their hands, and they themſelves carry it to their Mouths. The Churchmen do not daily ſay their Breviary; but one or two onely ſay it, and the reſt liſten. He that recites the Office is commonly a Prieſt, and they who are preſent for moſt part do not hear. Moſt of the <hi>Iberians</hi> hardly know the Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. If they have no Children by their Wives they divorce from them with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Prieſts, and marry others; which they doe alſo in caſe of Adultery and Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

The Nobles doe the ſame within their own Lands in regard of the Biſhops and Prieſts. The Prince has his Voice with the Biſhops in the Election of the Patriarch, and all chuſe him whom he deſires. The Will of the Prince and of the ſeveral Lords within their Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſtands for Law, and they have no Judges for examining the Juſtice of Cauſes; neither have they any particular Statutes to walk by, not ſo much as admitting Witneſſes.

The Biſhops who are commonly more ignorant than the Prieſts, never examine their Capacity, but onely if they have Money to pay for their Ordination; which amounts to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107630:44"/>the Price of a Horſe. Theſe Prieſts may not onely marry, according to the Cuſtome of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, before they are ordained, but they may alſo marry a ſecond time, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing a Diſpenſation from their Biſhop which coſts a Piſtol. Neither does the Patriarch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain a Biſhop, without he pay him the Summ of 500 Crowns. When any Man falls ſick he preſently ſends for a Prieſt, to aſſiſt him rather as a Phyſician, than as a Ghoſtly Father, who never ſpeaks to his Patient of Confeſſion; but by turning over the Leaves of a Book very attentively, he ſeems to ſearch for the true Cauſe of the Diſtemper, which he imputes to the Anger of ſome of their Images; for theſe People have a Belief, that their Images are ſometimes angry with them. And therefore the Prieſt orders the Patient to make an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to appeaſe the Wrath of the Image, that Offering conſiſts in Cattle or Money, and all the Profit comes to the Prieſt alone.</p>
               <p>It is farther obſerved in that Relation, that ſo ſoon as a Child is born into the World, the Prieſt does not more but anoint it with Oil, making the ſign of the Croſs on its Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and that Baptiſm is deferred untill the Child be about two years old. Then they baptiſe it dipping it in hot-water, and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it all over; at length they give it Bread that hath been bleſſed to eat, and Wine to drink: which appears to be the Ancient way of Baptiſm, when they adminiſtred at the ſame time Baptiſm, Confirmation and the Euchariſt. Theſe People believe that Baptiſm, conſiſts chiefly in the anointing with the Oil that hath been conſecrated by the Patriarch:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107630:45"/>which does not diſagree with the Doctrine of the Orientals, who call that Unction the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Zampi</hi> who was no leſs full with the prejudices of the Theology of the <hi>Latins,</hi> than the other Emiſſaries we mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, put many queſtions to them relating to that Theology. Amongſt other things he asked them, whether when they adminiſtred any Sacrament, they had a real intention to adminiſter it? And<note n="(1)" place="margin">Circal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentione, non ſanno che ſia, ſolo per uſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za celebrano e per l' Elemoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, per cio ſe ſia valida la conſecratione mi rimetto a' dottori.</note> thereupon he doubts, whether they truely conſecrate the Bread and the Wine, becauſe they know not what that intention means. He asked them beſides, wherein they made the Form of Conſecration to conſiſt? And having put that Queſtion to many of them, there was but one who gave him any ſatisfaction, and who in effect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed the words of Conſecration. But it is eaſie to judge, that the <hi>Mengrelian</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſatisfied Father <hi>Zampi,</hi> ſpeaks rather in the Senſe of the Father, than according to the Sentiment of thoſe of his Nation. What is ſtrangeſt of all, and which ſome will hardly believe, a <hi>Mengrelian</hi> Prieſt being by the ſame Father asked the Queſtion,<note n="(2)" place="margin">Interrogai uno di queſti Reverendi, ſe fatta la con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecratione del pane e vino con le ſodette paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le veramente dopo que pane e vino foſſe il corpo e ſangue di Chriſto?

But this does not at all agree with the Teſtimony, that Father <hi>Zampi</hi> gives in another Place of the Belief of that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107630:45"/>People concerning the Euchariſt. And ſeeing ſuch kind of Queſtions are impertinently made by the Emiſſaries to the People of the Eaſt, who are not at all acquainted with our Diſputes about that Sacrament, we are not to wonder at their Anſwers, if they ſuit not always with our Principles. The <hi>Mengrelian Papas</hi> on that occaſion conſulted onely his Senſes, and made an anſwer much like to that which the <hi>Capernaites</hi> made to our Lord, <hi>How can this Man give us his Fleſh?</hi> Father <hi>Zampi</hi> added another Queſtion as impertinent as the reſt. He asked the ſame <hi>Papas,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Caſe the Prieſt ſhould forget the words of Conſecration, would the Maſe be good? to which he anſwered, why not? The Prieſt, indeed would ſin; but the Maſs would ſtill be good. It is ſtrange an Emiſſary ſhould put ſuch Queſtions to People whom he knows to be in profound ignorance, and who are ſo far from underſtanding the Queſtions that have for ſome Ages onely been handled in the Schools, that they have but a ſlight Tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Principles of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>But that which ſcandalized Father <hi>Zampi</hi> the moſt, was the little Reſpect that the <hi>Papas</hi> of <hi>Mengrelia</hi> have for the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, which they keep not, as the <hi>Latins</hi> do, in precious Veſſels, but in a little bag of Leather or Cloath, which they always tye to their Girdle, carrying it about with them whereſoever they goe, to be made uſe of upon occaſions, when they are to give the <hi>Viaticum</hi> to the ſick. Nor doe they make any Difficulty to give it to be carried by others, whether it be Man or Woman: and ſeeing the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107630:46"/>Conſecrated Bread is hard, they break it into little Pieces to be moiſtened, without much regard to the ſmall Crums of that Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bread that fall upon the ground, or that ſick to their Hands.<note place="margin">[*]</note> [*] I confeſs theſe People pay not Veneration enough to that Auguſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: but, on the other hand, it is not reaſonable, to exact from them all the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worſhip that is rendered to it in the Weſtern Church, ſeeing they have not the ſame reaſons to doe it, having no <hi>Berengarians</hi> amongſt them, that might oblige them to give thoſe Exteriour Marks of their Belief. We can expect no more from them, than what was practiſed in the firſt Ages of the Church: And it is not peculiar to the <hi>Mengrelians</hi> alone to keep in a leathern Bag the Sacrament which is to ſerve for a <hi>Viaticum;</hi> the ſame is alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, who in that manner keep it faſtened to the Wall in their Churches.</p>

                  </note> Letter which he wrote to the Pope, wherein he Anathematiſes even thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Churches. Then he adds, that his Church of <hi>Babylon</hi> differs from other Churches of Hereticks, which have multiplied Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, without any Title, and without the Participation of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Patriarchate of <hi>Babylon</hi> hath been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the Authority of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as is to be found in their Annals, where it is mentioned that the Patriarchs of the Eaſtern Church were ordained at <hi>Rome,</hi> whither they ſent afterwards for obtaining the Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Election. But ſeeing it happened often, that thoſe who were ſent were killed by the way, it was at length after a long time, concluded by the Pope in Council, that he would ordain them a Patriarch, and give them
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107630:48"/>Liberty of Election for the future. And this, ſays the Patriarch <hi>Elias,</hi> is the Original of the Patriarchal See of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which we have not uſurped, having received that Dignity from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is eaſie to perceive that all this Hiſtory concerning the Original of the Patriarchate of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> hath been made on purpoſe by the Patriarch <hi>Elias</hi> who ſtood in need of the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Rome.</hi> The ſame Judgment we are to make of the Letters which the <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> aſſembled at <hi>Moſul</hi> for the Election of a new Patriarch, wrote to Pope <hi>Julius</hi> III. wherein they give him the Title of Head of all Biſhops, in the ſame manner as St. <hi>Peter</hi> was of all the other Diſciples. That is not the ordinary Language of the Orientals in regard of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom they do, indeed, acknowledge to be the chief of Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, but that, according to them, is onely a Primacy of Honour, and not of Juriſdiction and Power over the reſt.</p>
               <p>The ſame patriarch <hi>Elias</hi> annexed to his Letter the Confeſſion of Faith of his Church, where amongſt other Articles, it is ſaid, that the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father; that the Son hath taken a Body of the Holy Virgin; that he is perfect both in Soul and in Mind, and in all that belongs to a Man; that the Word having deſcended into a Virgin, was united to the Man, and became one thing with that Man, in the ſame manner as the Fire and the Iron are united together; that that Unity is without either Mixture or Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and therefore it is, that the Properties of each Nature cannot be deſtroyed after the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107630:48"/>Union; that they believe that Jeſus Chriſt who is begotten of his Father from all Eternity, as to his Divinity, was born of a Virgin in the fulneſs of time, and united with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Humanity. As to what is objected to them, that they call not the Virgin, the Mother of God, but Mother of Jeſus Chriſt: he anſwers, that they ſpeak in that manner, to condemn the <hi>Apollinarians,</hi> who pretend that the Divinity is without the Humanity; and to confound <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> who affirmed that Chriſt was onely Humanity without Divinity. He farthermore adds, that that is the Belief of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he receives all which that Church teaches; that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the Pope to be Head of all Churches, and that out of the ſame Church of <hi>Rome</hi> there is no Salvation.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing <hi>Elias</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> could not come to <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf, He diſpatched to the Pope ſome of the ableſt and moſt prudent Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, to make the Reconciliation of the two Churches. They together framed an Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Articles of their Religion, where they laid down, at length, the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling their Belief with that of the Church of <hi>Rome. Abbot Adam,</hi> who was one of the Deputies, was charged with that Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or Explanation; and the Patriarch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him with a Letter to the Pope<note n="(1)" place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>El.</hi> Patr. ad <hi>Paul. V.</hi>
                  </note> wherein he treats of that Reconciliation of Belief, and makes it appear that the two Churches differ onely in Ceremonies; but that as to the Doctrine of Faith all the Diſputes with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are but nominal. He
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107630:49"/>reduces thoſe Points of Belief, wherein he pretends to differ onely in Name from <hi>Rome,</hi> to five Heads, to wit, in that the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> call not the Virgin the Mother of God, but Mother of Chriſt; in that they aſſign to J. C. but one Power and one Will; in that they acknowledge in J. C. but one Perſon; in that they ſay barely, that the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father; and, in fine, in that they believe that the Light which is made on Holy Saturday at the Sepulchre of our Lord is a Light truly miraculous. The Patriarch <hi>Elias,</hi> having taken the Advice of the moſt knowing Men about him, pretends that in all theſe Points, they underſtand not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aright. And, in effect, <hi>Abbot Adam</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to juſtify himſelf in a long Diſcourſe, of which we ſhall onely here relate a Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, without ſpeaking of the two laſt Articles which are common to all the Orientals; the three firſt onely, relating particularly to the <hi>Neſtorians;</hi> and I find that that Abbot evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proves that the Modern <hi>Neſtorianiſm,</hi> is but a Hereſie in Name, and that it hath onely been condemned, becauſe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, the Abbot makes appear, that it is eaſie to reconcile the <hi>Roman</hi> Church which calls the Virgin Mother of God, with the <hi>Neſtorian,</hi> which calls her Mother of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> becauſe it is a Principle received by both Churches, that the Divinity neither ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates, nor is generated, ſo that the Virgin hath engendered <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is God and Man both together; but that it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be believed, that there are two Sons,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107630:49"/>but one onely true Son: inſomuch that there is in Jeſus Chriſt but one Filiation, and one onely viſible Perſon, which the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> call <hi>Parſopa.</hi> In fine, he concludes, that they deny not but that the Virgin may be called Mother of God, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is really God, and that that Doctrine is agreeable to the words of St. <hi>John</hi> in his Goſpel, of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzene:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſays he, according to theſe Principles, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> acknowledges really that the Virgin is the Mother of God, and the Orientals, with good reaſon, ſay alſo, that ſhe is Mother of Chriſt; and yet for all that differ not in Judgment.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, he examines the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that ſeems to be betwixt the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Churches, touching the Natures and Perſons in Jeſus Chriſt. It is certain the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> acknowledge two Natures and one onely Perſon in Chriſt: whereas the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> ſay that there are two Perſons in him, and one <hi>Parſopa</hi> or viſible Perſon; and beſides that there is but one Power and Virtue in him. He reconciles thoſe two Opinions that ſeem at firſt ſo different, by the explication which he gives of that Myſtery. The Orientals or <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> ſays he, according to the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are in Chriſt, diſtinguiſh in their Mind two Perſons; but with their Eyes they ſee but one Chriſt, who is onely the <hi>Parſopa</hi> or Appearance of one Filiation. And it is in that Senſe alſo, that the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but one Power or Virtue in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they look upon him but as one <hi>Parſopa</hi> or viſible Perſon; and ſo, by reaſon of that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107630:50"/>real and perfect Union which makes but one <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of two Natures, the Divine and Humane, they diſtinguiſh not a double Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Virtue, making the Terms to reſt on the Unity of Filiation. Whereas in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> theſe Powers or Virtues are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into Divine and Humane, becauſe they are conſidered with relation to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and it may eaſily be concluded from thence, that this Diverſity of Judgment is onely apparent, ſince, in effect, the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> confeſs with the <hi>Latins,</hi> that there are two Natures in Chriſt, and that each Nature hath its Power and its Virtue: and beſides, both Churches acknowledge, that there is no Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor Confuſion of thoſe two Natures, each retaining the Attributes which are proper to them. In fine, for a greater Illuſtration of his Opinion he adds theſe words: <hi>As the Fathers of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>acknowledge one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon becauſe of one Filiation; ſo they of the Eaſt acknowledge one Virtue or Power becauſe of one Filiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third place, he reconciles the Opinion of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> who aſſign but one Will and one Operation in Chriſt, with that of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> who acknowledge two VVills and two Operations in him. For compaſſing that, he inſiſts upon the ſame Principle of one Filiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which making but one Jeſus Chriſt; the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> ſay with relation thereunto, that there is but one VVill and one Operation in him, becauſe he is really one and not two. This, nevertheleſs, hinders them not from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging two VVills and two Operations, with relation to the two Natures, as the <hi>Latins</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:107630:50"/>doe: but they do not expreſs themſelves after their manner, becauſe theſe two Natures making but one <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> which is Jeſus Chriſt, they alſo ſay that he hath but one VVill and one Operation; which excludes not the two VVills and Operations that the <hi>Latins</hi> attribute to Chriſt, becauſe the <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> own him to be perfect Man. But ſeeing theſe two Natures are united together, and that the one VVill is never ſeparated from the other, they make both together but one and the ſame thing: and in that Senſe they aſſert this Unity of VVill; in which manner Chriſt alſo ſpeaks, when he ſaith, <hi>I am not come to doe my own Will, but the Will of him that ſent me.</hi> Then he concludes with theſe words: <hi>Are there two contrary Wills in Jeſus Chriſt? Not at all: but without any repugnance made by the Will of his Humanity, he wills that which the Will of his Divinity wills, to which it is ſubmitted, not by conſtraint; and therefore he ſaith to his Father, not my Will be done, but thine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> juſtified to <hi>Paul</hi> V. the Belief of their Churches, and that Juſtification or Reconciliation was not the VVork of one Man, but of the ableſt Men of the Nation whom the Patriarch <hi>Elias</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted. The truth is, there is flattery in the Articles which relate to the Sovereign Power of the Pope, and the Chriſtians of the <hi>Levant</hi> are not ſo ſubmitted to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> in theſe Acts do teſtifie: but that is pardonable in poor VVretches that ſolicite the Protection of that Court, becauſe there was no other means of approaching it, without giving the Pope that Supreme Power
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107630:51"/>and Juriſdiction over all the Churches in the VVorld. As to the other Propoſitions which are peculiar to the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> it will be found that Modern <hi>Neſtorianiſm</hi> is but an imaginary Hereſie, and that the Diverſity of Sentiments conſiſts only in Ambiguities, inaſmuch as the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> take the word <hi>Perſon</hi> in another acceptation than the <hi>Latins</hi> do. However, ſeeing Councils had condemned the Hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> it was, it ſeems, neceſſary that <hi>Neſtorianiſm</hi> ſhould appear at <hi>Rome</hi> to be a real Hereſie, ſince it had been condemned in the Church by a General Council. That Courſe <hi>Stroza</hi> hath taken in the Collection he hath made of theſe Acts; for he heaps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all that hath been ſaid by the Fathers and Councils againſt the Opinion of <hi>Neſtorius:</hi> Nevertheleſs, that he may not altogether thwart the Patriarch of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> who affirmed that all the difference that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and his own, in relation to their Belief, conſiſted onely in Ambiguities; he frankly confeſſes, that it is probable enough that the Errour of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> is more in the Underſtanding than Will, that is to ſay, that they are not Hereticks, as not being obſtinate; but onely ignorant of true Theology, which makes them erroneous; as if it were an Errour not to know the Terms which have not been in uſe but in ſome latter Ages amongſt the Divines of the Weſt.</p>
               <p>I do not think it needfull to produce in this Place all that <hi>Stroza</hi> alledges for condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Propoſitions of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſays nothing but what may be found
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107630:51"/>in the Acts of Councils. I ſhall onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that from the ſame Acts ſome might infer, that <hi>Neſtorianiſm</hi> is onely a Hereſie in Name, and that if <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> had underſtood one another, they might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled their Opinions, and thereby hindered a great Scandal in the Church. But the <hi>Greeks</hi> have been always great Diſputants; and therefore we find that moſt of the firſt Hereſies had their Original amongſt them; and that moſt commonly their Diſputes were onely metaphyſical, and about Ambiguities, from which afterwards, according to their Cuſtome, they drew Conſequences, and, at length, came to reproaches; whereby matters became irreconcileable: whereas if the parties had modeſtly explained their thoughts, there had not been, for moſt part, the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Hereſie in them. It ſeems to them that <hi>Neſtorius</hi> hath always acknowledged two Natures in Chriſt, which united together, made but one <hi>Compoſitum;</hi> and that he called a Perſon in <hi>Greek</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whence the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> have taken their <hi>Parſopa.</hi> Now it is certain, the Term <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, ſignifies that which we call Perſon and <hi>Hypoſtaſis.</hi> For as to the two Perſons which <hi>Neſtorius</hi> aſſigned to be in Chriſt, it was onely to explain that there were really two Natures in him, and that both remained entire without Mixture or Confuſion. In effect, beſides thoſe two Metaphyſical Perſons which were not diſtinguiſhed in Nature, he admitted another real viſible Perſon, in the manner as it is defined by the Ancient Fathers. Nay it will appear, that the Sentiment of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> if we
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107630:52"/>bar the Conſequences that St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> draws from it, is leſs perplexed with Difficulties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is more ſimple, and always regards Jeſus Chriſt in himſelf and as Son; whereas the other Opinion, moſt frequently conſiders him onely by parts, that is to ſay, ſometime as God, and ſometime as Man. Nor was the Opinion of <hi>Theodore</hi> of <hi>Mopſueſtia,</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> condemned in the Beginning, and it was never thought on, untill the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> made uſe of his Authority. It is, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, certain, That this <hi>Theodore,</hi> from whom <hi>Neſtorius</hi> had learnt the Opinion, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged two Natures and one Perſon in Jeſus Chriſt, as appears by his words mentioned in the fifth General Council: And if he denied that the Virgin was the Mother of God, it was onely to refute the Hereſie of <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> and in that Senſe onely, that the Virgin could not conceive the Divinity, though otherways he whom ſhe brought forth was very God. Let us now proceed to the other Articles of the Belief of the <hi>Neſtorians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing the Sect of the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> hath been rent from the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, it hath the ſame Opinions as ſhe hath, except that which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to it, and which was the Cauſe of the Separation. It may be, however, the <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> are greater Libertines as to ſome Points of Morality and Diſcipline, than the <hi>Greeks</hi> are; and without doubt it is in that Senſe that we ought to underſtand<note n="(1)" place="margin">

                  </note> what <hi>Brerewood</hi> relates concerning Confeſſion, which he denies to be amongſt them. It is true they neglect it very much, and the Archbiſhop <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a <hi>Neſtorian,</hi> who ſome years ſince was reconciled
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107630:52"/>to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had much adoe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh it in <hi>Diarbequer,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> though moſt of them Latinized, would not ſubmit to it, as I have learned from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chaldean</hi> Archbiſhop, a great Friend of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s, who hath ſuffered much for maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Intereſts of <hi>Rome.</hi> We muſt then explain all the other Points of the Religion of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> with relation to the Sentiments of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which is the ſource of all the Chriſtianity in the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>It is not to be denied, but that the <hi>Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> conſecrate in Leavened bread. They moreover, put into their Bread Salt and Oil, as may be ſeen in the Notes upon the Works of <hi>Gabriel</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> where the way of making and preparing that Bread, to make it proper for Conſecration, is related. They have, for that end, a great many Prayers which they ſay; however they obſerve fewer Ceremonies than the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient have added an infinite Number of new ones.</p>

And therefore it was impoſſible for the Jeſuits to make them forſake their ancient Cuſtoms, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them from the Submiſſion which they rendered to the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who was not in the Pope's Communion, no more than the Biſhops that were under his Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The Remedy therefore that was found for that, was to ſeize the Perſon of a certain Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop called <hi>Mar Joſeph,</hi> who had been ſent by the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to the end that by that means the People having no Paſtour, the Deſign might the more eaſily be brought about. But that Biſhop <hi>Mar Joſeph</hi> ordered that Maſs ſhould be celebrated according to the Cuſtome of <hi>Rome</hi> with Ornaments after the <hi>Latin</hi> Faſhion, and that they ſhould even make uſe of the Wine and Wafers of the <hi>Latins.</hi> Nevertheleſs he ſtill perſiſted in <hi>Neſtorianiſm,</hi> and taught the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> who ſerved him, to ſay, <hi>Holy</hi> Mary <hi>Mother of Chriſt,</hi> and not <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God:</hi> which obliged the Archbiſhop and Viceroy to arreſt him, in order to his being carried to <hi>Rome.</hi> But arriving in <hi>Portugal,</hi> he ſo well managed his Affairs, that he obtained
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107630:54"/>Letters again to be received into his Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Serra.</hi> In the mean time, there was another Biſhop already put in his Place, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mar Abraham,</hi> who to maintain himſelf in his Biſhoprick, went afterwards to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſubmit to the Pope, where having made an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration of his Hereſies, he was re-ordained. He had all the Orders given him anew, from the Tonſure to Prieſthood; then he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Biſhop, and the Pope empowred him by Bulls for governing the Church of <hi>Serra,</hi> adding thereunto Letters of Recommendation to the Viceroy, which ſtood him but in little ſtead: for he was no ſooner arrived, but that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Goa</hi> cauſed his Bulls to be examined; and finding that the Pope had been miſinformed by <hi>Mar Abraham,</hi> and that his Holineſs had been impoſed upon, he was ſhut up in a Monaſtery, in expectation of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from <hi>Rome.</hi> But he eſcaped and retired into the Churches of his Biſhoprick, where he was very well received by the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> who hoped no more for any Biſhop from their Patriarch. In the mean time, <hi>Mar Abraham</hi> who ſtill diſtruſted the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> retreated far up into the Countrey; and to ſhew that he was ſincerely in the Pope's Communion, he ordained anew all thoſe whom he had already ordained, that he might conform to the <hi>Roman</hi> Rite, and did all he could both with the Viceroy and the Archbiſhop, that he might appear to be really in the Judgment of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church. But he ſtill preached <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſm</hi> in his Church of <hi>Serra,</hi> and would not ſuffer the Pope to be called Head of the Church, as owning no other Patriarch, but
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107630:54"/>the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon.</hi> On the other hand, the Ancient Biſhop of <hi>Serra Mar Joſeph</hi> was accuſed of teaching the Hereſies of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and being thereupon queſtioned, he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red freely, that he had had a Revelation from God, aſſuring him that the Religion which he had received from his Anceſtours was the true Religion. So he was immediately made Priſoner, and ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> where he died.</p>
               <p>From this Hiſtory it may be gathered that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have uſed great Violence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> about Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; that the Emiſſaries, being Men unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Theology of the Eaſt, have diſturbed and moleſted them for Ceremonies of little or no Importance, and that they have thereby occaſioned the temporiſing of the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Biſhops, by introducing Novelties into their Churches, to which they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by Violence. And therefore it was that the ſame <hi>Mar Abraham</hi> having been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Pope's Brief, and more by the fear that he had of the Vice-roy, who gave him a Paſs-port, to repair to a Council, he there again abjured all theſe Errours, and made Profeſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Faith. But no ſooner was he come back to his Church, but that he taught <hi>Neſtorianiſm</hi> as before; and even wrote to his Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> had forced him to be preſent at the Synod of <hi>Goa.</hi> The ſequel of that Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcovers more plainly the Violences uſed by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> towards the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> to bring them to an Union with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to oblige them to ſubſcribe to the Confeſſion of Faith of <hi>Pius</hi> IV. which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107630:55"/>in the time of <hi>Alexis de Meneſes</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Goa,</hi> who went into the <hi>Indies</hi> with a Brief of <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. to inform againſt <hi>Mar Abraham.</hi> In that whole Relation there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears great Zeal in the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Chriſtians of that Countrey, for the Defence of their Faith, which they pretended to retain as being once delivered unto them by St. <hi>Thomas:</hi> In ſo much that they put their hands before their Eyes at the Maſs of the <hi>Latins,</hi> when the Prieſt elevated the Hoſt to be adored by thoſe that were preſent. Above all, they ſhew'd themſelves zealous for their Patriarch of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> and when they were asked whether the Pope was not Head of the Church, they made anſwer that he was Head of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is a particular Church, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and not of the Church of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> as being inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent one of another, which they obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately maintained. They, moreover, reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withſtood the Sacrament of Confirmation which Archbiſhop <hi>Meneſes</hi> would have admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto them; and they accuſed him of Envy and Ambition, alledging that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to overturn the Religion of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> to make them embrace that of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the end that by that Artifice, he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main abſolute Maſter of all the Churches of the <hi>Indies.</hi> And therefore, ſay they, that Archbiſhop calumniated the Patriarchs of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> proteſting, however, that they would perſevere in Submiſſion and Obedience to their patriarch, and that they would never forſake their Religion to embrace that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:107630:55"/>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe oppoſitions on the Part of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Meneſes</hi> ſtill perſiſted to inculcate to them that their Patriarch was an Heretick and Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and that therefore they could not pray for him. This he did ſo vigorouſly, ſparing neither Pains nor Money, that at length he ſoftened them. Sometimes he uſed Violence, and was therefore often in danger of his Life. For under Pretext that he had full Power from the Pope, he exerciſed his Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in all Places, without minding the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries of the Places, even before they had acknowledged his Character. And in this manner that Envoy of the Pope planted the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion in that Countrey, and ſpared no means to accompliſh his Deſign. He gave Orders in ſpight of the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhops, and made thoſe whom he Ordained firſt abjure the Errours of the <hi>Neſtorians.</hi> Beſides the Confeſſion of Faith, they who entered into Orders were obliged to ſwear Obedience to the Pope, and to acknowledge no other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, but ſuch as were ſent from him. But let us now come to the Errours of which <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> accuſes the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I.<note n="(1)" place="margin">Hiſt. Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. des progr. d' <hi>Alexis Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes,</hi> Chap. <hi>20.</hi>
                  </note> They obſtinately maintained the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and beſides that, they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no Images, admitting onely the Croſs which they much honoured. Nevertheleſs, there were Images of ſome Saints in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches adjacent to the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. They affirmed that the Souls of the Saints did not ſee God before the Day of Judgment.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:107630:56"/>
               <p>III. They acknowledged but three Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to wit, Baptiſm, Orders, and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt: and in the Form of Baptiſm there was ſo great an abuſe amongſt them, that in one and the ſame Church, different Forms of Baptiſm were in uſe; and by reaſon of that, it happened often that the Baptiſm was null: So that Archbiſhop <hi>Meneſes</hi> ſecretly rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed moſt Part of that People. There were alſo a great many, eſpecially the Poor, who lived in the woods, who had never been Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, becauſe Baptiſm coſt Money: And ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs though they had never been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, yet they went to Church, and received the Sacrament. Beſides, they often enough delayed Baptiſm for ſeveral Months, nay and for ſeveral Years.</p>
               <p>IV. They made no uſe of Holy Oil in the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm; unleſs that finding in their Rituals that there was mention made of anointing after Baptiſm, they anointed Children with an Unguent made of <hi>Indian</hi> Nuts, without any Benediction; and they eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Unction Holy.</p>
               <p>V. They had no Knowledge of Confirmation nor Extreme Unction; nay not ſo much as the Names of them.</p>
               <p>VI. They abominated Auricular Confeſſion, except a few that were Neighbours to the <hi>Portugueſe:</hi> And as to the Euchariſt, they communicated on Holy Thurſday and many other Feſtival-days, without other Preparation, than coming to the Sacrament faſting.</p>
               <p>VII. Their Books were full of conſiderable Errours, and in their Maſs there were a great many Additions inſerted by the <hi>Neſtorians.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:107630:56"/>
               <p>VIII. They conſecrated with little Cakes made with Oil and Salt, which the Deacons and other Churchmen, who were but in infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Orders, baked in a Copper Veſſel, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for that purpoſe a ſeparated Place in the Form of a little Tower; and whilſt the Cake was a baking, they ſung ſeveral Pſalms and Hymns: and when they were ready to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate, through a Hole that was in the Floor of that little Tower, they let the Cake in a little Basket made of Leaves ſlide down upon the Altar. Moreover, they made uſe of Wine made of Water, in which ſome dry Grapes had onely been infuſed.</p>
               <p>IX. They ſaid Maſs but very ſeldom, and he that ſerved at it, wore a kind of a Stole over his ordinary Cloaths, though he was not a Deacon. He had always the Cenſer in his Hand, and ſaid almoſt as many Prayers as he that celebrated, adding thereto many unknown and impious Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>X. They had ſo great a Veneration for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that there was not a Family where ſome Body was not in Orders: and the reaſon of that was, becauſe as Orders made them not incapable of other Employments, ſo they had every where the Precedence.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they obſerved not the Age requiſite for Prieſthood, and the other Orders; for they made Prieſts at the Age of 17, 18. and 20. Years: and when they were Prieſts, they married, even with Widows, and paſt to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third Marriages. The Prieſts Wives had ſome Place before others, aſwell in the Churches as elſewhere, and they were to be known by a Croſs which they carried about
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107630:57"/>their Neck, or ſome other. thing that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed them.</p>
               <p>XI. They went daily to Church to reade the Liturgy aloud in the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Tongue: but they did not think themſelves obliged to repeat it elſewhere; neither had they any Breviaries for ſaying it in Private.</p>
               <p>XII. They committed Symony in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Baptiſm and the Euchariſt, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting rates of the Price they were to receive for them. For their Marriages, they made uſe of the firſt Prieſt that they found, eſpecially thoſe who lived in the Countrey.</p>
               <p>XIII. They had an extraordinary reſpect for their Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> a Schiſmatick, and Head of the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Sect: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they could not endure that the Pope ſhould be named in their Churches, where moſt commonly they had neither Curate nor Vicar, but the ancienteſt preſided in them.</p>
               <p>XIV. Though on Sundays they went to Maſs, yet they did not think themſelves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to it in Conſcience; ſo that they were at Liberty not to goe, nay there were ſome Places where Maſs was ſaid but once a Year, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers where none was ſaid in 6, 7. and 10. Years.</p>
               <p>XV. The Prieſts diſcharged Secular Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. The Biſhops were <hi>Babylonians</hi> ſent by their Patriarch, and lived onely by ſordid Gain, and Symony, ſelling Publickly Holy things, as the Collation of Orders, and the Adminiſtration of other Sacraments.</p>
               <p>XVI. They are fleſh on Saturdays; and were in this Errour in regard of the Faſts of Lent and the Advent, that if they had failed to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107630:57"/>Faſt one day, they faſted no more, thinking themſelves not obliged to it, becauſe they had already broken their Faſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the greateſt Part of the Errours which Archbiſhop <hi>Meneſes</hi> pretends to have found amongſt the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and which the Compiler of that Hiſtory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerates, to ſhew that extraordinary Labour was needfull for gaining theſe People. But if that Archbiſhop and other Emiſſaries into the Eaſt, had been well acquainted with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Theology, they would not have ſo mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied Errours. In effect, ſeeing they meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all things by the Rule of the Theology which is taught in the Schools of <hi>Europe,</hi> it is not to be thought ſtrange, that they would needs reform the Oriental nations according to that Standard. I confeſs, there were abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes there that needed amendment; but they ought not to have been rectified according to our Cuſtoms. The Courſe that was to have been taken on theſe Occaſions was to have turned back unto their Ancient Books, and to have reformed them according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents thereof; and that might have been eaſily done, as will appear in the Sequel of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. But we muſt firſt relate the reſt of that Hiſtory, that we may be able to make the better Judgment on the Conduct of <hi>Meneſes,</hi> and of the pretended Errours of the <hi>Neſtorians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Archbiſhop <hi>Meneſes</hi> called a Synod the 20th. of <hi>June</hi> 1599. where the Deputies of the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> were preſent, to deliberate jointly with the Archbiſhop about Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And that it might appear that the <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> had all the Liberty that is neceſſary upon
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107630:58"/>ſuch Occaſions, and that on the other Hand, they might give their Conſent to all that ſhould be decreed there, the Archbiſhop gained Eight of the moſt Famous Churchmen, and fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them of his Deſign, and of the ways that were to be taken for ſucceeding in it, giving them the particulars of all the Decrees that were to be made there, and asking their Opinion upon every diſtinct Point, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had as yet been reſolved upon; to the end that being preſent in the Synod, they might doe the ſame, and thereby oblige the reſt to follow their Example. He took many other meaſures for ſucceeding in his Deſigns, which, it would be to no purpoſe, to relate; and all that hath been hitherto alledged, is onely to ſhew the manner how the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion hath been eſtabliſhed in the Eaſt, and that it is not to be thought ſtrange, that all the Reconciliations that have been made with thoſe People whom we call Schiſmaticks, have been of no long Duration.</p>
               <p>It was then decreed in that Synod, that the Prieſts, Deacons, Subdeacons, and beſides all the Deputies of Towns that were preſent ſhould ſign the Confeſſion of Faith, that the Archbiſhop had privately made by himſelf; which was done, and all ſolemnly ſwore obedience to be Pope, whom they acknowledged to be Head of the Church, ſwearing alſo that they would enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no more Commerce with the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Moreover they Anathematized the Perſon of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and all his Errours, owning <hi>Cyrill</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> for a Saint. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a great many particular Statutes were made in that Synod, for reforming the Errours
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107630:58"/>that Archbiſhop <hi>Meneſes</hi> pretended to be in the Adminiſtration of their Sacraments, and in their Books. And therefore he cauſed their Liturgies and other Offices to be rectified. He regulated the matter of Marriage, according to the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Penance, Confirmation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction were likewiſe reformed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Prieſts were for the future prohibited to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and regulations were made for thoſe who were already married. In a word, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop introduced the Religion of the <hi>Latins</hi> amongſt the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> as well in that synod, as in the Viſitations which he made of ſeveral Churches. But let us now conſider, if he had reaſon to introduce ſo many Novelties amongſt the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas;</hi> which will ſerve to diſcover the Religion of thoſe People.</p>
               <p n="1">I. As to what concerns the Errours which Archbiſhop <hi>Meneſes</hi> imputes to them; we have in the foregoing Chapter reconciled the Sentiments of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> with thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that was the way that the Archbiſhop ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with them, if he intended to have eſtabliſhed a laſting Reformation: for he ought to have heard them, before he condemned them for being called <hi>Neſtorians.</hi> When it had been made clear to them, that all the Diſputes which they had with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> conſiſted onely in the Ambiguity of Terms, they would have become a great deal more tractable and docile.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:107630:59"/>
               <p>II. As to Images, the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> reverence them not ſo much as the <hi>Greeks</hi> do, becauſe that great Veneration of Images was not ſo firmly eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, but ſince the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which was poſteriour to all the Sects of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are ſatisfied with a Croſs in their Hand; and that Croſs wherewith the Prieſt bleſſeth the People, is of plain Metal without any figure. The Archbiſhop might very well have let the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> alone in that Ancient ſimplicity, becauſe all that hath been ſince that time decreed concerning Images, is but barely matter of Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>III. It is very true they adminiſter not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm after the manner of the <hi>Latins;</hi> but it is not therefore to be thought, that the form of their Baptiſm is invalid; and it was far leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to rebaptize thoſe who had been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized according to the <hi>Chaldean</hi> rite. That which deceives the Emiſſaries, when they treat about Affairs of Religion with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entals, is the prejudices which they have learned in the Schools concerning the Matter and Form of Sacraments. When, for inſtance, they ſee that the Child is not baptized at the ſame time that the words which denote the Action are pronounced, they take the Baptiſm to be null; without conſidering that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of adminiſtring the Sacraments amongſt the Orientals, conſiſts chiefly in certain Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which they ſay, and that they are not ſo great Metaphyſicians as the <hi>Latins;</hi> which makes them ignorant of a vaſt number of Difficulties, that our Divines handle with much ſubtilty; but the Belief of the <hi>Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:107630:59"/>is not therefore leſs pure, nor leſs Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
               <p>IV. The Unction which they uſe after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is with them the Sacrament of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that differs much from that of the <hi>Latins:</hi> And it was not needfull that Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Meneſes</hi> ſhould have introduced another Unction that was practiſed in his Church, and which at moſt was no more than a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. He ought to have known that the <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> according to the Ancient Practice of the Eaſtern Church, adminiſter to Children Confirmation and the Euchariſt with Baptiſm. It had been then fit, to have examined their Rituals, to ſee whether any abuſe might not have crept into the Adminiſtration of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: whereas <hi>Meneſes</hi> his chief care ſeems to have been, to aboliſh moſt Ancient Cuſtoms, becauſe they were not agreeable to the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Latins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. The Archbiſhop is miſtaken, when he ſays that the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> had no Knowledge of Confirmation, nor of Extreme Unction, and were ignorant of the very Names. It may be, they might have been ignorant of the Names of theſe Sacraments, eſpecially of Extreme Unction, which is no where known, but in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church: for though the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Church hath the Cuſtome of anointing the Sick, according to the words of St. <hi>James,</hi> yet ſhe calls not that Ceremony Extreme Unction, for the reaſons we mentioned before, when we ſpoke of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> and the ſame reaſons may be alſo applied to Confirmation. The Prieſts adminiſter that Sacrament amongſt the <hi>Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as well as amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> at the ſame
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107630:60"/>time they do Baptiſm, of which, according to them, it is a perfection that ought never to be ſeparated from it. As to Auricular Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which they had in abhorrence, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an abuſe introduced into that Church, becauſe the uſe of Confeſſion is in all the Eaſt, though moſt part think not themſelves obliged to it by Divine Right.</p>
               <p>VI. As to the Errours which the Archbiſhop pretends to have found in their Books, ſo far as that they would have entirely abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the Office of Advent, it was eaſie to have given a good meaning to all theſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Errours; beſides that, the Reformation which he made in their Liturgy was impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: for there is nothing worſe digeſted than the Maſs of the <hi>Noſtorians,</hi> in the manner as it hath been reformed by <hi>Meneſes,</hi> and as it is found inſerted in the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum.</hi> The whole Order of it is changed, in endeavouring to accommodate that Liturgy to the Opinion which the <hi>Latin</hi> Divines have of Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they make to conſiſt in theſe words, <hi>This is my Body, &amp;c.</hi> whereas the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> believe, as all the Orientals do, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration is not completed, till the Prieſt hath ended the Prayer, which they call the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt. Nevertheleſs <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> makes the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Prieſts adore the Hoſt, ſo ſoon as they have pronounced theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> though they believe it not to be as yet conſecrated. About this Queſtion the Notes on <hi>Gabriel</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> may be conſulted, where the Authour particularly juſtifies the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> and proves clearly, that their Liturgies, even that which carries the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107630:60"/>Name of S. <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> contain nothing but what is Orthodox: which is far from the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of <hi>Meneſes,</hi> who calls them impious and heretical, and who onely defends the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that he hath made, by theſe general Terms, that their Liturgies were full of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies. The ſame Authour affirms that in one of the Liturgies for the uſe of the <hi>Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which he had from a <hi>Babylonian</hi> Prieſt, the Name of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> with many other things were blotted out, and others added that were not of the ſame hand writing, becauſe the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Prieſt who made uſe of that Liturgy, was reconciled, at leaſt in appearance, to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; which obliged him to reform in his Miſſal all that might diſguſt the Divines of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Neſtorians</hi> have alſo done the like on another occaſion, as <hi>Stroza</hi>
                  <note n="(1)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Petr. Stroza</hi> de dogm. Chald.</note> relates: for ſo ſoon as they come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and hear <hi>Neſtorius</hi> ſpoken of as an impious Perſon and Heretick, they tear out the Leaves of their Books where mention is made of him, taking away all that they believe to be contrary to the Theology of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. Their Cuſtome of conſecrating with Leavened bread, mingling therein Oil and Salt, ought not to be reckoned amongſt their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, ſince that does not alter the Nature of Bread. The Ceremony, beſides, which they obſerve to render, in ſome ſort, the Bread more Holy before the Conſecration, is Laudable, nay and Ancient. They thereby diſtinguiſh, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> do, the Bread that is deſtin'd to be made the Body of Chriſt, from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bread, which they look upon as profane, before they have ſaid over it a certain Number of Prayers and Pſalms.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:107630:61"/>
               <p>VIII. It is no matter of wonder, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> do not ſay Maſs ſo often as the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> do, and that many Prieſts are preſent at the Biſhops Maſs, and take the Communion from his hands. That is an ancient Practice in the Church: whereas the Cuſtome of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many Maſſes in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, is very late, and hath been chiefly introduced by Mendicant Monks, as it is obſerved by Cardinal <hi>Bona;</hi> which Practice hath been much fortified ſince the Introduction of the new Law. It is alſo a very ancient Cuſtome that they who ſerve and are preſent at Maſs, rehearſe a good part of it; and that, becauſe the Liturgy is a Publick Action which concerns the People, and may be eaſily proved even by the Prayers of the <hi>Latin</hi> Maſs.</p>
               <p>IX. It is true the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> and other Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entals, are grown remiſs, in the Ancient Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline as to what relates to Orders, and that they obſerve not the Age required by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons: But if that wanted to be reformed, as well as what concerns the Marriage of Prieſts, the Reformation ſhould have been taken from their Laws, rather than from thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> All Men know that in the Eaſtern Church Prieſts are allowed to marry before their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. This, Archbiſhop <hi>Meneſes</hi> ought to have conſidered in reforming them, and not to have diſſolved the Marriage of Prieſts, that he might conform to ſome Statutes made in the Synods held at <hi>Goa</hi> by ſome <hi>Latin</hi> Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>X. <hi>Meneſes</hi> ſeems to have been miſtaken in reckoning the Cuſtome of not ſaying the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary out of the Church, amongſt their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107630:61"/>becauſe that Practice is new, and that the Breviary was not made to be ſaid in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</p>
               <p>XI. I doubt whether the Rates that the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Prieſts ſet for the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, ought to be called Symony, becauſe that is to them inſtead of a Benefice; and what hath been ſaid before when we ſpoke of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> may be applyed to them.</p>
               <p>XII. I think the Submiſſion that the <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> have for their Patriarch, ought not to be reckoned an Errour neither; becauſe the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entals look upon all Patriarchates, even that of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Powers eſtabliſhed by poſitive Law: And if it be objected to them as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, that they have an Averſion to the Pope, they anſwer that the Pope takes to himſelf Rights over the Churches of the Eaſt, which theſe Churches do not acknowledge. As to their not having Curates nor Vicars, but that the Eldeſt Prieſt preſides in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; that cannot rationally be called an Errour: on the contrary, it is an Excellent Diſcipline; and it were to be wiſhed, that it were eſtabliſhed in all Churches, for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to many abuſes, which are at preſent in Benefices.</p>
               <p>XIII. In fine, moſt part of that which <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes</hi> calls Corruptions amongſt the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> is not ſo in effect, unleſs it be in the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome Emiſſaries, who meaſure Religion according to what they have been taught in their Schools. Can it be ſaid, for inſtance, that it is an Errour in theſe People, and other Chriſtians of the Eaſt, to eat fleſh on Saturday,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107630:62"/>which amongſt them is a Feſtival-day agreeable to the ancient Practice of the Church? Can it be ſaid alſo, that the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> err in relation to Marriage, becauſe they take the firſt Prieſt that they meet with to marry them? We muſt know that in the Eaſtern Church the Prieſt is not barely a Witneſs of the Marriage; but that he is the onely and true Miniſter of it, as of the other Sacraments and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>

They even pretend that they explain the Myſtery of the Incarnation, ſaying that there is but one Nature, becauſe there is but one Chriſt, God and Man, better than the <hi>Latins</hi> do, who ſpeak, ſay they, of theſe two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as if they were ſeparate, and did not conſtitute a real <hi>Compoſitum.</hi> In that Senſe is it alſo, that <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> who ſoftened ſome Terms of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> which appeared too harſh, ſaid that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107630:63"/>he acknowledged that Chriſt was compoſed<note n="(1)" place="margin">Ex duabus naturis.</note> of two Natures, but that he was not<note n="(2)" place="margin">Duas na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turas.</note> two Natures; which ſeems to be Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox: for they will not acknowledge that there are two Natures in Chriſt, for fear of aſſerting two Chriſts. Nor do I doubt, but that if ſome bold Expreſſions, and the Conſequences that are commonly drawn from them, were laid aſide in the Opinion of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> it might be eaſily reconciled with the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> All the difference proceeds onely from the different uſe of the words <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Perſon;</hi> and the deſire of maintaining what once hath been aſſerted, as in effect, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches</hi> defended his Opinion with headſtrong Wilfulneſs and Obſtinacy: ſo that all the Terms that he makes uſe of, are not to be taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rigour of the Letter; but they ought to be explained and limited according to the <hi>Idea</hi> which he had conceived of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting but one Chriſt, and therefore but one Nature, after that the Union of the two Natures, to wit, the Divine and Humane, is made in a manner which we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. For that which is attributed to <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> that he believed that the Body of Chriſt was a Divine Body, and of a Nature diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from ours, is rather the Oratory of the Preacher, who might ſay that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt after the Union was in a manner made Divine, than a real and phyſical Truth. However, there was reaſon for condemning that Sentiment, becauſe ſuch ways of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are to be avoided, which may be wrong interpreted, and occaſion Errours in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <hi>Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> relates of them is not always true. For inſtance, they deny not Purgatory, nor the Prayers for the Dead, as he affirms after <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas à Jeſu;</hi> but they have the ſame Opinion, as to that, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Orientals have. Nor is it true that they conſecrate in Unleavened bread, unleſs it be underſtood of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and according to <hi>Alvares,</hi> of the <hi>Ethiopians:</hi> for the true <hi>Jacobites,</hi> of whom we ſpeak in this Place, conſecrate with Leavened bread; and I make no doubt but that <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. who had a Deſign of erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a College at <hi>Rome</hi> for the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> as he had done for the <hi>Maronites,</hi> would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to conſecrate in Leavened bread, in the ſame manner as it was allowed to the <hi>Greeks.</hi> In regard of Confeſſion, neither is it true that it is not practiſed amongſt them: but ſeeing they believe it not to be of Divine Right, no more than moſt of the Orientals do, that is the reaſon why it is neglected.

               <p>There is a great difference to be made then, betwixt the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> when under that Name are comprehended the <hi>Cophties, Abyſſines</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> and thoſe who are properly called <hi>Jacobites:</hi> for though they all follow the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that ſame <hi>James</hi> from whom they have taken the Name, yet for all that, they differ in ſome Ceremonies. <hi>Abraham Ecchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſis</hi> alledges that the <hi>Jacobites</hi> believe aſwell

               <p>IT is probable that the <hi>Cophties</hi> or <hi>Copties</hi> have had their Name from a Town called <hi>Coptus,</hi> which was heretofore the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Thebais</hi> mentioned by <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Plutarch.</hi> The Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of <hi>Egypt</hi> carry that Name at preſent, and they have alſo a particular Language, which is called the <hi>Coptick</hi> Tongue, though they uſe it not but in their Offices, <hi>Arabick</hi> being the Language of the Countrey: And that Language, which the Jeſuit <hi>Kircher</hi> pretends to be a Mother-tongue independent of any other, hath been much altered by the <hi>Greeks:</hi> for beſides that it ſtill retains the Characters, a very great Number of its words are pure <hi>Greek.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Belief of theſe People is the ſame as that of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> for they are <hi>Monophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites,</hi> as we obſerved when we ſpoke of the <hi>Jacobites;</hi> and therefore it is to no purpoſe to repeat what we ſaid in that Place. They have at ſeveral times made ſeveral Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107630:64"/>with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but onely in outward appearance.<note n="(1)" place="margin">

This Jeſuit having had ſome Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with two <hi>Cophties,</hi> whom the Patriarch <hi>Gabriel</hi> had deputed for that purpoſe, eaſily perſwaded them of the Pope's Authority: but when the Jeſuit afterwards preſſed the ſame Patriarch to ſend Letters of Submiſſion and Obedience to the Pope, telling him that he ought not to ſcruple at that, ſeeing in his former Letters, he had called the Pope Father of Fathers, Paſtour of Paſtours, and Head of all Churches; he made anſwer, that ſince the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and the eſtabliſhment of divers Patriarchs independent one of another, every one of them was chief and abſolute Maſter in his own Church; and that if even the Patriarch of <hi>Rome</hi> fell into any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, he ought to be judged by the other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs. He farther anſwered, that as to the Letters which he had written to the Pope, it ought not to be taken ſtrictly, what was onely meant for Civility and Modeſty; and that though he ſpoke of Obedience and Submiſſion, yet that was no more than Friends commonly doe one to another. In fine, he added, that if there was any thing in thoſe Letters which he wrote to the Pope, that was not agreeable
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107630:65"/>to the Doctrine of his Church, it ought not to be imputed to him but to the Carrier of the Letters, who without doubt had corrupted them. In this manner did the Patriarch of the <hi>Cophties</hi> entertain the Pope's Envoys, after that he had received from the Conful, the Money that was ſent him from <hi>Rome.</hi> This Hiſtory is more largely related by<note n="(1)" place="margin">

The ſame Jeſuit <hi>Roderigo</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves amongſt the Errours of the <hi>Cophties,</hi> that they put away their Wives, and Marry others; that they circumciſe their Children before Baptiſm; that they acknowledge, indeed, ſeven Sacraments; but that beſides Baptiſm, Confeſſion, the Euchariſt and Orders, they reckon in the ſame rank, Faith, Faſting and Prayer, not to ſpeak of others. He ſays far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the <hi>Cophties</hi> do not believe that the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Son; that they admit but of three Councils, to wit, of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Nice.</hi> But ſome of theſe pretended Errours, are either common to all the Eaſtern Church, or they particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> who have rejected the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> As to their reckoning amongſt the Sacraments, <hi>Faſting, Prayer</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> they take not the word Sacrament in that ſtrict Senſe we do; and that inclines me to believe that they call none properly Sacraments, but the four firſt; and that ſome Myſtical Doctors have afterwards added the other three, to make up the Myſtical Number of Seven. In fine, we may obſerve that it is not true that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107630:65"/>the <hi>Cophties</hi> believe as the <hi>Latins</hi> do, that the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father and the Son, as<note n="(1)" place="margin">

He obſerves, that when the Prieſt elevates the Hoſt in time of Maſs, they who are preſent knock their Breaſts, caſting themſelves upon the ground, and making the ſign of the Croſs; and that they move their Cap a little; which ſeems to me to be a <hi>Latin</hi> Ceremony: nor do I think the <hi>Cophties</hi> elevate the Hoſt, unleſs it be after the manner of the Orientals, to wit, a little before the Communion, which is of no long ſtanding neither in their Church. Poſſibly Father <hi>Vanſlebio</hi> might have ſeen that Ceremony in ſome of the Churches of the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> who might have taken it from the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> that have had Churches in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> where Maſs was celebrated after the manner of the <hi>Latins.</hi> The ſame Authour remarks,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107630:66"/>that when the Prieſt communicates, he breaks the bread in form of a Croſs, and that he puts it into the Wine; of which he eats three little Morcels with as many Spoonfulls of the <hi>Species</hi> of Wine; ad that he communicates thereof to him who ſerves at Maſs. He adds, that they keep not the Holy Sacrament after Maſs; and that they never conſecrate in private Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but always in the Church; that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate with Leavened bread, which before the Conſecration they all <hi>Baraca,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>Benediction;</hi> and <hi>Corban,</hi> or <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> after it is conſecrated; that they make uſe of little Loaves about the Bigneſs of ſomewhat leſs than a Crown piece, whereof they bake a great Number the Night before the Liturgy; and that they diſtribute them at the End of Maſs to thoſe who have been preſent.</p>
               <p>He farther ſays, that they uſe not Tavern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, becauſe they think it profane, and that in Places where no Wine is to be had, they infuſe Raſins in water; that they never confeſs and communicate but in Lent; that the Laicks communicate in both kinds, and that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Wine in a Spoon from the Hands of the Prieſt; that they give the Communion alſo to Children ſo ſoon as they are baptized; that all reade the Holy Scripture in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, which is the Language of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; that they celebrate on Saturday as well as Sunday; and that in one Year they have two and thirty Feſtivals of the Virgin, which are reckoned up by the Authour: and amongſt others, he takes notice of the Feſtival of a certain Image of the Virgin, which miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107630:66"/>was changed into Fleſh, the Hiſtory whereof is written in an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Book, which treats of the Miracles of the Virgin.</p>
               <p>The ſame Father <hi>Vanſlebio</hi> relates at large the Ceremonies which they obſerve in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and are performed in this manner: for that purpoſe they celebrate a Maſs after Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, accompanied with many Prayers; and after they have ſung for ſome time, the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons carry the Children to the Altar, who are anointed with Holy Oil: and then they ſay that the Children are become new Spiritual Men. This being done, they begin to ſing, and the Children are anointed a ſecond time, making upon them the ſign of the Croſs ſeven and thirty times; which ſerves them for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſm. Again they continue to ſing, and the Women who are preſent at the Ceremony make a loud Noiſe in token of Joy. In the mean time, water is put into the Baptiſmal Fonts, and the Prieſts draw near. He that baptiſes, bleſſes the water, pouring in Form of a Croſs Holy Oil into the ſame: then with one Hand he takes the Child by the Right Arm and Left Leg, and with the other Hand, by the left Arm, making a kind of a Croſs with the Limbs of the Child, which they cloath in a little white Garment; and during all this, the Prieſts ſtill continue to reade and ſing, and the Women to cry, or rather to houl. At length the Prieſt breaths three times in the Child's face, to the end, ſay they, that he may receive the Holy Ghoſt. No ſooner is the Child baptized, but the Prieſt gives it the Communion; which he doth, by dipping his Finger into the Chalice, and putting it into the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107630:67"/>Child's Mouth. All theſe Ceremonies being ended, they light the Tapers, and make a Proceſſion, ſinging in the Church. The Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons carry the Children in their Arms, and the Prieſts goe before them; after them follow the Men and Women who have been preſent at the Ceremony, the Women houling after their ordinary manner.</p>
               <p>They have, according to the ſame Authour, four great Faſts in the Year, the firſt whereof begins before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and laſts 24 days: The ſecond is Lent, which laſts 60 days: The third is called the Faſt of our Lord's Diſciples, which begins the third Holy Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and laſts 31 days: And the fourth, which laſts fifteen days, is the Faſt of our Lady in <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Images are held in great Veneration amongſt them, though they have no Statues; and the moſt uſual Images are thoſe of Our Lord, of the Virgin, of St. <hi>George,</hi> of Angels, to wit, St. <hi>Michael,</hi> St. <hi>Gabriel,</hi> St. <hi>Raphael,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others. They kiſs thoſe Images, and burn Lamps before them, with the Oil of which they anoint themſelves when they are ſick. It is probable they have no other Sacrament of Extreme Unction, but that kind of anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; unleſs perhaps they do it with a little more Ceremony.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved that Father <hi>Vanſlebio</hi> in his relation ſpeaks of the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> aſwell as of the true <hi>Cophties</hi> or <hi>Egyptians,</hi> becauſe, in effect, they are both <hi>Cophties</hi> in Religion, and Subject to the ſame Patriarch, who commonly reſides in <hi>Cairo;</hi> and becauſe there are but a few <hi>Cophties</hi> in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which ought to be the Place of his Reſidence. This Patriarch
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107630:67"/>takes the Title of Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and calls himſelf the Succeſſour of St. <hi>Mark.</hi> He extends his Juriſdiction over both <hi>Egypts,</hi> over <hi>Nubia</hi> and <hi>Abyſſinia.</hi> He hath beſides eleven <hi>Cophty</hi>-Biſhops depending on him, to wit, the Biſhops of <hi>Jeruſalem, Behneſe, Atfih, Fiur, Moharrak, Montfallot, Sÿut, Abutig, Girgium, Negade</hi> on <hi>Girge,</hi> and laſtly the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of <hi>Abyſſinia.</hi> After the Biſhops, the Archprieſts are next in degree, and are very numerous amongſt them; next to them come in order, the Prieſts, Deacons, Readers and Chanters.</p>
               <p>As to their Office; on Saturday in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Sun ſet, the Prieſt attended by his Miniſters goes to Church to ſing Veſpers which laſt about an Hour; and thoſe who are preſent ſleep afterwards in the Church. They who do not ſleep, ſmoke Tobacco and drink Coffee, or otherwiſe diſcourſe about what they pleaſe. Two Hours after Midnight they ſay matins, and afterwards Maſs, to which many do reſort. When they enter the Church, they take off their ſhoes, and kiſs the ground near the Door of the Sanctuary; then draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to the Archprieſt, they kiſs his Hand, bowing that they may receive his Bleſſing. If the Patriarch be preſent, and do not officiate, he ſits on a Throne raiſed above the Prieſts, having a Copper Croſs in his Hand; and after all have made the uſual Reverence before the Sanctuary, they make it again before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, and kiſs the ground near him, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they riſe and kiſs the Croſs and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch's Hand.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:107630:68"/>
               <p>Seeing moſt of theſe Ceremonies are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the Orientals, I ſhall inſiſt no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon them, nor upon their way of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating Maſs, which may be ſeen in the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Father <hi>Vanſlebio;</hi> beſides, they differ but little from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from whom they have borrowed a great Part of their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. That which is obſerveable, and which might be brought into practice in the <hi>Latin</hi> Churches is, that they have a Book of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies taken out of the Chief Fathers, of which they reade ſomewhat, after the reading of the Goſpel; and that ſerves as an Explication or Paraphraſe upon the ſame Goſpel, ſo that there is no need of Preachers to inſtruct them.</p>

               <p>SEEING we have treated at large of the Religion of the <hi>Cophties,</hi> and that the <hi>Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines</hi> differ not from them therein, we ſhall not be long on that Subject.</p>
               <p>Ancient <hi>Ethiopia</hi> is at preſent called <hi>Abaſſia,</hi> and the People who inhabit it <hi>Abyſſines.</hi> They have but one Biſhop to govern them, who is ſent to them by the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that reſides at <hi>Cairo;</hi> ſo that in all things they follow the Religion of the <hi>Cophties,</hi> excepting ſome Ceremonies that are peculiar to them.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107630:68"/>They have alſo a particular Language which they call <hi>Chaldaick,</hi> becauſe they think it has been derived from <hi>Chaldea,</hi> though it be very different from the ordinary <hi>Chaldaick,</hi> and therefore it is called the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Language. They uſe that Tongue in their Liturgies, and in other Divine Offices, though it be old, and different from the vulgar <hi>Ethiopian.</hi> They who underſtand <hi>Hebrew,</hi> may eaſily learn that Language, becauſe there are many words common to both: yet it hath particular Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; and whereas in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language the Points which ſerve for Vowels are not joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Conſonants, in the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Tongue there is no Conſonant but which at the ſame time makes its Vowel.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Abyſſines</hi> have made many advances towards a Reunion with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And there are ſeveral of their Letters written to Popes, of which the moſt conſiderable is<note n="(1)" place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> ad <hi>Clem. VII.</hi>
                  </note> that of <hi>David,</hi> who takes the Title of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the greater and upper <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and many other Kingdoms, written to <hi>Clement</hi> VII. to whom he made great Submiſſions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that he would obey him. But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> have never had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to <hi>Rome</hi> and to the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> but for ſetling their Affairs, when they have been in Diſorder; and that they have ſlighted them ſo ſoon as they were any ways ſuccesfull, as may be ſeen in the Hiſtories of the <hi>Portuguſe,</hi> which need not to be mentioned in this Place. All Men know what became of <hi>John Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> who was made Patriarch of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and conſecrated at <hi>Rome;</hi> at the ſolicitation of the <hi>Abyſſines</hi> themſelves, who pretended that for

                     <hi>Alex. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ.</hi> Hiſt. Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</note> 
                  <hi>Alexis Meneſes,</hi> whom we mentioned before, thought himſelf obliged to uſe his utmoſt endeavours for reconciling thoſe People to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and having taken the Title of Primate of the <hi>Indies,</hi> he pretended to extend his Juriſdiction alſo over <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> And therefore he ſent Emiſſaries with Letters to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> living in that Countrey, writing at the ſame time to the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> whom he earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhorted to ſubmit to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He farther urged, that he ought not to make any difficulty of obeying that Church, ſince the Patriarch of the <hi>Cophties</hi> and his whole Church, had lately ſubmitted to it; which he proved by the very Acts and Inſtruments of that Patriarch's Legation, which are inſerted in the End of the fifth Tome of the Annals of <hi>Baronius,</hi> whereof he ſent him a Copy, but he knew not that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had been overreached in that Point, and that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> had too eaſily publiſhed theſe Acts under the Name of the true Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and of the Church of the <hi>Cophties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, it is to be obſerved, that <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and many others are miſtaken, when they accuſe the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> of Judaizing in their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107630:69"/>becauſe ſome of them obſerved Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; that beſides, they celebrated Maſs on Saturday as well as Sunday, and that they abſtained from Blood and Fleſh that had been Strangled. The Circumciſion of the <hi>Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> differs from that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who look upon it as an indiſpenſable Precept, whereas the former reckon it onely a Cuſtome that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates not at all to Religion; the Women amongſt them being even Circumciſed. This makes me think, that that Ancient Cuſtome hath been onely introduced amongſt them for ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Parts that are circumciſed more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Generation. As to Saturday and things Strangled, that is not peculiar to the <hi>Abyſſines:</hi> all the Oriental Church obſerves the ſame practice, without being dyable for that to the Cenſure of <hi>Judaiſm;</hi> ſince Saturday, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ancient Canons, is a Feſtival day as well as Sunday. And as to their abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Blood, and Meat that hath been Strangled, it is a Conſtitution of the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, which hath ever been obſerved in the Weſtern Church. From this laſt remark, it may be concluded, that the Jeſuit <hi>Roderigo</hi> ought not to have preſt the <hi>Cophties</hi> ſo much in the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that he had with them, to lay aſide all thoſe Ceremonies; and beſides that, the <hi>Coph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> did not ſpeak ſincerely, when they told him that they erred in their opinions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Repudiation of Wives, Circumciſion of Children, and their abſtaining from Fleſh that was Strangled. Beſides theſe remarks, we are alſo to take notice, that many things are imputed to the <hi>Abyſſines</hi> which are remote from their belief. For inſtance, it is alledged that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107630:70"/>they agree with the <hi>Latins</hi> as to the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt; which is confirmed by the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian</hi> Liturgies Printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein it is ſaid that the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father and the Son. But we are not always to rely upon what is Printed at <hi>Rome:</hi> for it is certain that the <hi>Abyſſines</hi> differ not from the reſt of the Orientals touching the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Nor are we to believe neither, all that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas à Jeſu</hi> hath written concerning the belief of the <hi>Abyſſines;</hi> Nay and the<note n="(1)" place="margin">Thomas à Jeſu.</note> Acts that he hath inſerted in his Book, touching their belief, are not always true, though the Confeſſion of Faith which he produces comes from <hi>Tecla</hi> an <hi>Abyſſine</hi> Prieſt: for it ſaith expreſly, that the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father and the Son, which nevertheleſs is not their belief. It is likewiſe obſerved, that the <hi>Abyſſines</hi> believe that the Tranſubſtantiation of the Bread and Wine is made, when the Prieſt pronounces the words, wherein the <hi>Latins</hi> make the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration to conſiſt. It is notwithſtanding cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Liturgy of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> is in that point agreeable to all the other Oriental Liturgies, and that the Conſecration is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, according to their opinion, but when the Prieſt invokes the Holy Ghoſt, in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prayer, which is to be found in all the Miſſals of the Eaſtern Nations. I wave a great many other points, which are not altogether well expreſs'd according to the belief of the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that relate to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: but theſe miſtakes may eaſily be corrected by what we have ſaid before, when we ſpoke of other Oriental Nations; ſo that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107630:70"/>we ſhall not inſiſt any more upon that Subject; and it will be eaſie by that Method, to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what <hi>Brerewood</hi> hath related upon the Credit of theſe Authours.</p>

               <p>THE Victories obtained by <hi>Scha-Abas</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> over the <hi>Armenians,</hi> within theſe late Years when he entred <hi>Armenia,</hi> have almoſt ruined that Church, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſtill retains the Names of ſome Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopricks, Biſhopricks and Monaſteries, but which are, for moſt Part, in great Diſorder. I have informed my ſelf exactly enough of the Preſent State of the Church of <hi>Armenia,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had many Conferences upon that Subject with an <hi>Armenian</hi> Biſhop, who took the Title of Biſhop of <hi>Uſcovanch,</hi> and who was at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> in the Year 1662. for Printing an <hi>Armenian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, according to the Commiſſion he had from his Patriarch: For ſeeing the Manuſcript <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Bibles were exceſſively dear, and that that hindered private Perſons from reading the Scripture, the Patriarch took a reſolution of cauſing it to be Printed. From that Biſhop, who was called <hi>Uſcam,</hi> I had the Memoirs of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Churches, which I have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned<note n="(1" place="margin">See the Collections at the End of the Book. <hi>F.</hi>
                  </note> at the End of this Book; and ſince
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107630:71"/>that time I have converſed with him freely at <hi>Paris;</hi> but having conſulted him about ſeveral Points relating to the Theology of the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> I found him not to be very skilfull in thoſe matters. He died at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> whither he went by permiſſion from the King to cauſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Armenian</hi> Books to be Printed, for the uſe of his Countreymen. The Cardinals of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation <hi>de propagandâ fide</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> were ſurpriſed that a Liberty of Printing all ſorts of <hi>Armenian</hi> Books had been ſo eaſily granted in <hi>France;</hi> becauſe, perhaps, he might have cauſed bad Books to be Printed, which might have favoured the <hi>Armenian</hi> Sect. But his Conduct during the time that he was in <hi>France,</hi> was very reſpectfull towards the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now concerning the Belief and Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church, no Man hath treated of it more amply than <hi>Galanus,</hi> in the Book which he publiſhed at <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Reconciliation of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church with the <hi>Roman.</hi>
                  <note n="(1)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Galan. Cler.</hi> Reg. in Concil. Eccl. Arm. cum Rom.</note> That Book is divided into two Parts, of which the firſt is but an Abſtract of the Hiſtories of the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians:</hi> but ſeeing the <hi>Armenians</hi> have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided amongſt themſelves for ſeveral Ages, and that they have had recourſe to <hi>Rome</hi> in their Neceſſities, aſwell as the other Orientals, I have found theſe Hiſtories not to be always ſincere and exact. And therefore what I here take from <hi>Galanus</hi> touching the <hi>Armenians,</hi> I ſhall accompany with ſome Reflexions. The ſame Authour hath added Notes upon his Hiſtory: but becauſe he was an Emiſſary and wrote at <hi>Rome,</hi> we muſt not, before we have
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107630:71"/>exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, give credit to all he ſaith. Nevertheleſs that Book contains a great many Curious things concerning the State and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Armenians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved then. I. That the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Hiſtories tranſlated by <hi>Galanus,</hi> mention a certain Inſtrument of Reunion betwixt the <hi>Roman</hi> and the <hi>Armenian</hi> Churches under the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Tyridates</hi> King of the <hi>Armenians, Sylveſter</hi> then poſſeſſing the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> who is the great Patriarch of the <hi>Armenians</hi> poſſeſſing that of <hi>Armenia</hi> But beſides that there are many things in that Inſtrument which appear to be fabulous, it is probable that that Piece, as to the greateſt part of it, hath been forged in the following Ages, eſpecially in the time of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> III. when the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church ſought to be reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For there are in it ways of ſpeaking concerning the Supremacy of Popes, which were not in uſe at that time. The <hi>Armenians,</hi> however, as <hi>Galanus</hi> obſerves, make uſe of that Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the Antiquity of their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate, which was, according to them, erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Pope <hi>Sylveſter:</hi> And they have even alledged it in their Diſputes with the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But that will appear to be a weak Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe who know Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, and ſhall conſider the great extent of Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Pope <hi>Sylveſter</hi> takes to himſelf in that Inſtrument.</p>
               <p>II. All Men know that the <hi>Armenians</hi> are of the Sect of the <hi>Monophyſites,</hi> who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but one Nature in Jeſus Chriſt. But as we have already obſerved when we treated of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107630:72"/>the <hi>Jacobites;</hi> that is but an imaginary Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, conſiſting onely in the Ambiguities of words. And yet it occaſions great Diſputes at this day amongſt the <hi>Armenians;</hi> for though they be for the moſt part ignorant in Divinity, yet they talk rationally of the Myſtery of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> which they reject. We are to obſerve, however, that a good many <hi>Armenians</hi> are at preſent reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Sentiments they follow, and that <hi>Galanus</hi> hath had a great hand in that Reconciliation in the time of Pope <hi>Urban</hi> VIII.</p>
               <p>III. It is not true that the <hi>Armenians</hi> deny the real Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt, as<note n="(1)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Brerew.</hi> of Lang. and Rel. Chap. <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Brerewood</hi> from no good Authour does affirm: for the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and Orientals have not diſputed ſo much about that Sacrament, as the <hi>Latins</hi> have, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the time of <hi>Berengarius;</hi> and in reſpect the <hi>Armenians</hi> have never examined that difficulty, they have continued in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Terms of the Change of the Symbols into the Body and Bloud of Our Lord. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,</hi> who mentions ſome of their Synods, and the Diſputes they have had with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> takes no notice at all of that, but onely that they mingle no Water with the Wine in cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the Liturgy, and that they conſecrate in Unleavened bread, after the Manner of the <hi>Latins.</hi> What the ſame <hi>Brerewood</hi> affirms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Purgatory is to be underſtood accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what we have mentioned before of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Orientals; and it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that what is ſaid in the ſame place, that they deny that the Sacraments have the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107630:72"/>Virtue of conferring Grace, is the <hi>Chimera</hi> of ſome Scholaſtick Doctour, who imagined that the Orientals were acquainted with all the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties of the <hi>Latins.</hi> Nor do I think it true that the <hi>Armenians</hi> refuſe to eat of all Animals that are eſteemed unclean in the Jewiſh Law, which <hi>Brerewood</hi> imputes alſo to the <hi>Abyſſines:</hi> But that which hath given occaſion to this Belief is, that the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Abyſſines</hi> with the reſt of the Eaſtern Chriſtians abſtain from bloud and things ſtrangled; wherein there is no Superſtition.</p>
               <p>It is to no purpoſe to enlarge upon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the <hi>Armenians</hi> who are not Latinized; ſince there hath been enough ſaid of that when we ſpoke of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> from whom they differ in nothing but in ſome Ceremonies, and in what concerns Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline. However, I think it will not be taken amiſs, if I give here a Catalogue of the chief Errours, which<note n="(1)" place="margin">Joan. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac. <hi>apud</hi> Galan.</note> a certain Latinized <hi>Armenian</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to them; and that will ſerve for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what we have already alledged, and at the ſame time give occaſion of clearing ſome other Points. That Authour reproaches his Countreymen who are not reconciled to the Pope, that they follow the Errours of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> concerning the Unity of Nature in Chriſt; that they believe that the Holy Ghoſt proceeds only from the Father; that the Souls of the Saints deceaſed goe not to Heaven, nor thoſe of the damned to Hell, before the laſt Day of Judgment; that there is no place called Purgatory and Hell, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no Supremacy over other Churches.

He objects to them alſo their Cuſtome of conſecrating in Wooden and Earthen Chalices; that all Prieſts indifferently give abſolution for all Sins, there being no reſerved Caſes amongſt them; that they are ſubject to two Patriarchs, who ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take the Title of Patriarch of all <hi>Armenia;</hi> that the Curates and Biſhops ſucceed to one another, as if their Dignities were Inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; that the Sacraments are bought and ſold amongſt them; that Divorces are given for Money, without any reaſon; that they make no Holy Oil for Baptiſm and Extreme Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that in fine, they give the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to Children before they attain to the uſe of reaſon.</p>
               <p>From this whole Catalogue it appears that the <hi>Armenian</hi> who is the Authour of all theſe pretended errours, was Latinized; for as we have obſerved before, moſt part of theſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are common to all the Chriſtians of the Eaſt, in the Manner as we have explained them when we treated of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The <hi>Armenians</hi> are, indeed, to be blamed that they
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107630:75"/>are too ſcrupulouſly addicted to certain Faſts which they have in great Number, and that they are not exactly enough inſtructed in the Myſteries of Religion. There are none in the Eaſtern Church that ſet a greater Value upon Faſts than the <hi>Armenians;</hi> and to hear them ſpeak, one would ſay that their whole Religion conſiſted in faſting. As to their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Perſeverance in celebrating the Feſtival of Our Lord's Nativity, and the Epiphany always on one and the ſame day; they ſeem not to be blameable therein; becauſe it was a Cuſtome long practiſed in the Church; and in effect the Epiphany or Apparition of Our Lord is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly nothing but his Birth.</p>
               <p>The Title of Maſter or Doctour is ſo great amongſt the <hi>Armenians,</hi> that they give it with the ſame Ceremonies that they confer Orders;<note n="(1)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Galan.</hi> in Concil. Eccleſ. Armen. cum Rom.</note> and they ſay that that Dignity imitates the Title of Our Lord; who was called <hi>Rabbi,</hi> or Maſter. Theſe are the Doctours who are conſulted in Points of Religion, and who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide in them. The Biſhops being lookt upon rather as Perſons proper for adminiſtring Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, than as Doctours. Theſe are alſo the Doctours who Preach in the Churches, and who are the Judges of Differences that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen betwixt private Perſons.

He made great Progreſſes in <hi>Armenia</hi> in the time of Pope <hi>John</hi> XXII. having by his Preaching drawn many Monks over to his Party, who were uſefull to him in reuniting the two Churches. About that time was the Order of St. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> ſetled in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and theſe Monks were called <hi>United Friars,</hi> becauſe of the new Reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This Order which was onely eſtabliſhed to deſtroy the Ancient, got in a ſhort time great Reputation; inſomuch that the <hi>United Friars</hi> built Monaſteries not onely in <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Georgia,</hi> but alſo on the other ſide of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xine Sea,</hi> eſpecially at <hi>Caffa,</hi> which at that time was ſubject to the <hi>Genoeſe.</hi> But ſince the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> are become Maſters of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the Number of the <hi>United Friars</hi> is much decreaſed; and there remains but a few of them at preſent who have retired into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Naſcivan</hi> in the greater <hi>Armenia,</hi> where being at length, reduced to utmoſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, they have united themſelves with the <hi>Dominican</hi> Monks of <hi>Europe;</hi> and are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubject to the General of that Order, who ſends thither a Superiour Provincial.</p>

                  <hi>Dandini,</hi> who was ſent by <hi>Clement</hi> VII. in Quality of <hi>Nuncio</hi> to the <hi>Maronites</hi> of Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> hath written a Relation of his Travels in <hi>Italian,</hi> which hath been lately Tranſlated into <hi>French,</hi> with Notes, declaring at large the Religion of thoſe People. Seeing the Authour of theſe Notes
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107630:77"/>hath played the Critick upon the Miſtakes of that Jeſuit, and of many others who have ſpoken of the <hi>Maronites,</hi> I thought I could not doe better, than here to give an Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſwell of the Relation of the Jeſuit <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini,</hi> as of the Critical Remarks, from whence we may learn the Belief and Preſent State of thoſe People.</p>
               <p>It is hard to know exactly the Original of the <hi>Maronites.</hi> They who bear that Name pretend they derive it from one <hi>Maron</hi> an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, whoſe life <hi>Theodoret</hi> hath written, and who lived about the beginning of the fifth Century. This Opinion, which is followed by <hi>Brerewood,</hi> is ſtrongly confirmed by the Jeſuit<note n="(1)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sacchini</hi> in hiſt. Societ.</note> 
                  <hi>Sacchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> who pretends aſwell as the Modern <hi>Marc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> do, that theſe People were never ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Unity of the Church, and that that which gave occaſion of making them to be thought Schiſmaticks was, that the renewing of their Reconciliation to the Catholick Church hath been taken for a real Converſion to the Catholick Faith, and that the Errours which have been found amongſt them, have been imputed to them, as if they had been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of the ſame; whereas they were onely the Errours of Hereticks amongſt whom they lived. But though this Opinion appear at firſt Glance to have ſome probability in it, yet there is no ground for it; and the Teſtimonies of <hi>Eutychius</hi>
                  <note n="(2)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eutych.</hi> in Annal.</note> patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of <hi>Gulielmus Tyrius, Jacobus Vitricenſis,</hi> and many others, are evident Arguments to prove that that Nation hath really been of the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Monothelites:</hi> and they who look upon <hi>Monotheliſm</hi> as an Hereſie, ought alſo
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107630:77"/>to conſider <hi>Maron</hi> as an Heretick, though the <hi>Maronites</hi> honour him with the Title of Saint in all their Offices. It is to be believed then, as a certain truth, that theſe People having been ſeparated from the Church about the ſpace of five hundred Years, abjured their Hereſie, whether true or imaginary, before <hi>Aymeric</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>Gulielmus Tyrius.</hi> Before that time they profeſſed that they acknowledged but one Will and one Operation in Chriſt, though they confeſſed there were two Natures in him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maronites</hi> have a Patriarch who reſides in the Monaſtery of <hi>Cannubin</hi> on Mount <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus,</hi> and takes the Title of Patriarch of <hi>Antioch.</hi> He meddles not at all in temporal Affairs; but there are two Lords who take the name of Deacons or Adminiſtratours, who govern the whole Countrey being under the Dominion of the <hi>Turk,</hi> to whom they pay great Tributes. The Election of that Patriarch is made by the Clergy and the People, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Ancient Diſcipline of the Church: but ſince they have been entirely reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he is obliged to take Bulls of Confirmation from the Pope. He, and his Suffragan Biſhops never Marry; and it is to be obſerved that there are two ſorts of theſe Biſhops: for ſome are really Biſhops, having a true Title and People whom they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern; the others are properly no more than Abbots of Monaſteries, and have no Cure of Souls. Theſe laſt wear not the Habit of a Biſhop, nor any Mark of that Dignity; but they are cloathed like other Monks, though,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107630:78"/>they are diſtinguiſhed from them, by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre and Crozier when they celebrate Maſs. The Patriarch not being able alone to viſit all Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> hath always two or three Biſhops about him; and beſides the Biſhops of Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> there are others alſo at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus, Aleppo,</hi> and in the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the other Churchmen, they may all Marry before their Ordination; and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch himſelf not long ſince obliged the Prieſts to doe ſo, before he gave them Orders, unleſs they would become Monks: for the People who are jealous, are not pleaſed to ſee young Prieſts without Wives. However, ſince they have had a College at <hi>Rome,</hi> where part of their Churchmen are bred, they are allowed to live a ſingle Life, without being moleſted for it. Before they ſtudied at <hi>Rome,</hi> they were as ignorant as the common People, affecting no more but to learn to reade and write: And they paſſed for learned Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, who beſides the <hi>Arabick,</hi> which is the Language ſpoken in the Countrey, had any Knowledge of the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Tongue; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Liturgies and other Books of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are written in that Language.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Monaſtick</hi> Life is no leſs eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Maronites,</hi> than it is in all other places of the <hi>Levant.</hi> Their Monks are of the Order of St. <hi>Anthony:</hi> And it is probable they are a remnant of thoſe Ancient <hi>Hermites,</hi> who inhabited the Deſarts of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine;</hi> for they are retired into the moſt hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ſecret places of the Mountains, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from all Commerce. Their Habit is mean and courſe, they never eat fleſh, even in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107630:78"/>their greateſt ſickneſs, and drink Wine but very ſeldom. They know not what it is to make Vows: but when they are received into the Monaſtery, one of the Monks holds a Book in his hand, and all he does is, to reade in it ſomewhat that Concerns them, and admoniſh them of their Duty, for inſtance, that they obſerve continence; which is enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Chaſtity without being ingaged to it by Vows, as thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are. They have Goods and Money in property, which they may diſpoſe of at their Death; and when they are weary of one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, they goe to another, without asking their Superiours leave. They can perform no Eccleſiaſtical Function, ſuch as preaching and confeſſing; ſo that they are wholly their own Men, having no ſpiritual Exerciſe in common for the ſervice of their Neighbour. They work with their hands and cultivate the ground according to their Inſtitution. In fine, they ſignally practiſe Hoſpitality, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Monaſtery of <hi>Cannubin,</hi> where there is an open Table kept during the whole Year. We ſhall not here treat of their Belief, becauſe it differs not from the other Orientals, except in that which cauſed their Schiſm, wherein they are no more at preſent, being entirely ſubmitted to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> They even conſecrate with Unleavened bread; but it is probable that they have taken up that Cuſtome ſince their Reunion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though the Modern <hi>Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> pretend that they never conſecrated with Leavened bread.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:107630:79"/>
               <p>Their Maſs differed much from that of the <hi>Latins:</hi> But their Miſſal has been reformed at <hi>Rome,</hi> and they are prohibited to make uſe of any other Miſſal but of that which is reformed. They perform no Office without much cenſing, eſpecially at Maſs, wherein they neither uſe <hi>Maniple</hi> nor <hi>Stole,</hi> as the <hi>Latins</hi> do, nor ſo much as <hi>Chaſables,</hi> unleſs ſince they have been ſent them from <hi>Rome;</hi> but inſtead of <hi>Maniple,</hi> they wore on each Arm a little piece of ſilken or woollen ſtuff died, which is ſewed to the <hi>Albe,</hi> or even ſometimes looſe. The Prieſts ſay not Maſs privately, as <hi>Latin</hi> Prieſts do, but they ſay altogether ſtanding round the Altar, where they aſſiſt the Celebrating Prieſt, who gives the Communion to all, and to the Laicks under both Kinds: but the Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> daily introduce the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind. They made not the Conſecration to conſiſt in theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> &amp;c. But in more words which contained the Prayer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Invocation of the Holy Ghoſt. Nevertheleſs, at preſent, in that and many other things they follow the Sentiments of the <hi>Latin</hi> Divines, which have been taught them at <hi>Rome.</hi> As to the other Offices, they ſay them in the Church, whither they goe at Midnight to ſing their <hi>Matins,</hi> or rather their <hi>Nocturns.</hi> They ſay their <hi>Laudes</hi> which may be called <hi>Prime,</hi> at break of day; their <hi>Tierce</hi> comes before Maſs, after which they ſay their <hi>Sixth;</hi> their <hi>Nones</hi> are ſung after Dinner; <hi>Veſpers</hi> at Sun ſet; and at laſt, their <hi>Compline</hi> after Supper, before they goe to bed. Every Office is compoſed of a Preface, of two, three,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107630:79"/>and ſometimes more Prayers, with a like Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Hymns betwixt them. They have moreover proper Offices for Holy days, Lent, the moveable Feaſts, and for other days. The Prieſts and other Churchmen who are in Holy Orders, think not themſelves obliged to ſay the Office, when they cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Quire, unleſs it be ſince the <hi>Latins</hi> have thought fit to oblige them to it.</p>
               <p>Their Faſts differ much from ours; they onely obſerve Lent, and then they do not eat till two or three Hours before Sun ſet. They faſt not in the Emberweeks, nor in the Vigils of Saints, or of any other Feſtival; but inſtead of that they have other abſtinences which they ſtrictly obſerve; for they eat no Fleſh, Eggs nor Milk two days of the Week, to wit, Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday and Friday, and on theſe two days they taſte not of any thing, before Noon; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, every one is free to eat aſmuch and as often as he pleaſes. In the ſame manner they faſt twenty days before <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> and the Monks prolong that Faſt. At the Feaſt of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they all faſt during a fortnight, and as long at the Feſtival of the Aſſumption of the Virgin.</p>
               <p>Biſhops expect not the Emberweeks for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of Orders, as they do in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church; but they adminiſter them indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently on all Holy days: and before the late Reformation was brought in amongſt them, they gave in one day to one and the ſame Man, the Orders of Lector, Exorciſt, Acolyte, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, Deacon, Prieſt, Archprieſt and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop; and all in two or three Hours time. It is to be obſerved alſo, that they uſe as many
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107630:80"/>Ceremonies in making an Archprieſt, as in conferring other Orders; and it ſeems they look upon it as an Order diſtinct from the reſt.</p>
               <p>They keep no Water in their Baptiſinal Fonts, that hath been bleſt on Holy Saturday, for adminiſtring the Sacrament of Baptiſm; as is done in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church: but as often as any is preſented to be baptized, they bleſs the Water, by ſaying a great many Prayers; then they dip the Perſon to be baptized three times in the Water, or beſprinkle it thrice therewith, it being firſt a little warmed. Yet they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce but once the neceſſary words when they name the Perſon; they make no uſe of Salt: but they anoint not onely the Head, but alſo the Breaſt with their open Hands. They anoint alſo the Body before and behind from head to foot; and beſides that Unction which is performed before Baptiſm, they have another alſo after, which is properly the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Orientals: but ſince their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they have aboliſhed it, that they may adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Confirmation after the Manner of the <hi>Latins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heretofore they took no great care to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs before the Communion: but the Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Rome</hi> have obliged them to it at preſent. All the Prieſts alſo were equal in Juriſdiction in Matters relating to Penance, before their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. There were no caſes reſerved to the Patriarchs and Biſhops. Neither before that time, did they uſe great Reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, which they kept in their Churches without any lamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107630:80"/>ſhut up in a little box, and hid in a hole in the wall, or in ſome other place.</p>
               <p>Nor did they then publiſh their Marriages in Churches, before the Ceremony was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated: nay, and for that they took all ſorts of Prieſts indifferently, not thinking it neceſſary to have recourſe to the Curate. There were beſides, ſome who Married before the Age of 12. and 14. Years. And as to the Impediments of Marriage, they differ'd much from the preſent practice of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Degrees of Kindred, they reckoned not onely from the Head and firſt of the Line, but thought alſo that two branches ſpringing from the ſtock, as two Brothers are, made two Degrees; ſo that imagining they Married not but in the ſixth Degree, they married, in effect, in the third. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they held that for an impediment which was none; for they ſuffered not two Brothers to Marry two Siſters, nor the Father and the Son to Marry the Mother and the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>They practiſe a certain Unction for the Sick, which they call <hi>Lamp,</hi> becauſe, in reality, they make uſe of the Lamp-oil for it, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. They make a little Cake ſomewhat big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than an Hoſt, wherein they put ſeven Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches twiſted of little ſtraws, and place all in a Baſin with Oil, then reading a Goſpel and an Epiſtle out of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> with ſome Prayers, they light all the Matches. That being done, they anoint with the Oil the Forehead, Breaſt and Armes of all that are preſent, and of him who is ſick, ſaying at every Unction, by this Unction God pardon thy ſins, ſtrengthen and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107630:81"/>corroborate thy Members, as he ſtrengthened and corroborated thoſe of the Paralytick. Afterward they let the Lamp burn ſo long as the Oil laſts; and ſeeing that Oil hath onely been bleſſed by a ſimple Prieſt, many have believed, that that Ceremony was not the Sacrament of Extreme Unction, ſince it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to thoſe who are not dangerouſly ſick. But they who are acquainted with the Oriental Theology, will eaſily be perſwaded that thoſe People had no other Sacrament of Extreme Unction, before the <hi>Latins</hi> reformed them: nor indeed is the word Extreme Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any where in uſe but amongſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> becauſe they anoint not the ſick but when they are at the Point of Death; a thing not obſerved amongſt the Chriſtians of the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude this Diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Maronites,</hi> I will here ſubjoin an abſtract of what<note n="(1)" place="margin">P. <hi>Beſſon,</hi> Syrie Sainte.</note> Father <hi>Beſſon</hi> the Jeſuit hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his Book entituled <hi>La Syrie Sainte,</hi> where he chiefly ſpeaks of the <hi>Maronites</hi> who inhabit that Part of Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> which is called <hi>Queſroan.</hi> This Jeſuit thinks that the <hi>Maronites</hi> derive their name from St. <hi>Maron</hi> a <hi>Syrian</hi> Abbot, and not from <hi>Maron</hi> the <hi>Hereſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch;</hi> and amongſt other Arguments that he alledges to prove this, he ſaith that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronites</hi> have been accuſtomed after that the Clergy and People had choſen a Patriarch, to apply themſelves to the Pope for obtaining his Confirmation. But he ought to have minded, that they had no recourſe to the Pope before their ſtrict Conjunction with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He farther adds that <hi>Johannes Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenus</hi> could not be ignorant of the Hereſie of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107630:81"/>the <hi>Maronites,</hi> if they had really been Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, becauſe he was their Neighbour; and yet in the Liſt that he makes of Hereſies, he ſpeaks not of them. But that was needleſs, ſeeing they are comprehended under the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of the <hi>Monothelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Authour in a few words takes notice of what the Jeſuit <hi>Dandini,</hi> and ſome others of the Society have done amongſt the <hi>Maronites;</hi> which we have mentioned more fully with neceſſary Reflexions on it. All that can be ſaid, is that that Emiſſary Jeſuit, ſeems to me to be ſillier than the reſt, when he ſpeaks of the Belief of the <hi>Maronites.</hi> And therefore I think there is no credit to be given to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle which he relates as an evident Proof of the Orthodox Faith of the <hi>Maronites.</hi> He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that three Miles from <hi>Cannubin,</hi> near to a Village called <hi>Eden,</hi> there is a <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Church that goes by the Name of St. <hi>Sergius,</hi> and that above that Church there is a Chapel dedicated to St. <hi>Abdon</hi> and St. <hi>Sennan,</hi> where there is a Fountain of Spring-water, which runs under the Altar during Maſs, the Day on which the Feſtival of thoſe two Saints is celebrated. He ſays, beſides, that though that Feaſt be moveable, falling always on the firſt. Sunday of <hi>May,</hi> yet there is never any change in the courſe of that Fountain, which is always conſtant to the firſt Sunday of <hi>May</hi> even ſince the Calendar hath been reformed by <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. But I make no doubt but that this is a made ſtory, poſſibly to authorize the <hi>Gregorian</hi> reformation of the Calendar, which that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have on many occaſions refuſed to admit. And the rather it appears to be ſuppoſitions,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107630:82"/>in that the Authour aſſures us that that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which runs during Maſs, ſends forth water in greater abundance, when the Prieſt elevates the Hoſt; not minding that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is not in uſe amongſt the <hi>Maronites,</hi> in the manner that it is practiſed amongſt the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins.</hi> However Father <hi>Beſſon</hi> relates this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, as an evident Argument againſt the other Eaſtern Nations, for authoriſing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion which the <hi>Maronites</hi> have towards the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and at the ſame time for confirming the Reformation of the Calendar. That Relation likewiſe affirms that the <hi>Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> are of a very ſoft and ſweet temper, and that they give good words at leaſt, promiſing to doe what ever they are deſired; that it is often in their Mouth, that God is bountifull, and that he will proſper the thing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them; and that they frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Name of God, or ſome of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes. But as theſe People are of a good and eaſie Nature, adds the ſame Authour, ſo they are alſo very inconſtant. After they have heard a good Sermon, you ſhall ſee them fully reſolved to be converted, and to make an exact Confeſſion of their Sins; but when they are to come to performance; they appear inſenſible. Their Women, are indeed, very modeſt, but the greater they are in Quality, the leſs they come to Church: inſomuch that to enhance the Quality of a Lady, they ſay of her, that ſhe never hears Maſs but on <hi>Eaſter</hi>-day; nor does that happen yearly nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When a Maid is Married ſhe keeps at home two years without going to Maſs, and in the mean time ſhe frequents the Baths and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107630:82"/>Weddings. It ſeems they are baniſhed the Churches, as the Mahometan Women are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Moſques. There is nevertheleſs a Monaſtery of Nuns of the Order of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> who are held in great Reputation of Sanctity. Their whole Fabrick is hardly any more than a Church, where theſe Nuns are lodged, like Pigeons in their Neſts, in little odd holes made betwixt the Arch and the Floor. Theſe little Cells are ſo low that they cannot ſtand upright in them, and hardly is there room enough to hold their Bodies. All their employment is to ſing the Office, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, Pray and Work. Their Prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin about two in the Morning; and they work from day break, buſying themſelves in cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Gardens, and the Grounds of their Monaſtery.</p>
               <p>In fine, Father <hi>Beſſon</hi> aſſures us in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of his Book, wherein he ſhews the great Antipathy that is betwixt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and the <hi>Franks,</hi> that in <hi>Syria</hi> they ſay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly but one Maſs a day, even on Sundays; that they have but few Altars, and ſewer Prieſts; that all, except the <hi>Maronites,</hi> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate with Leavened bread; that the Prieſts who celebrate not, are notwithſtanding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at Maſs, and take their places, but in an ordinary Habit, unleſs they be thoſe that ſerve as Deacons and Subdeacons; and laſtly, that all communicate in both kinds, except the <hi>Maronites,</hi> whoſe Prieſts that communicate without celebrating the Liturgy, receive a little Piece dipt in the Bloud of Our Lord.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> A Supplement to what hath been ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Maronites.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THough what hath been mentioned before relating to the <hi>Maronites,</hi> ſeems to be built upon good grounds, yet a Learned <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronite</hi> Profeſſour of the <hi>Arabick</hi> Language in the College <hi>Della Sapienza</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> hath uſed all his endeavours to prove that his Countrey was never guilty of the Hereſie that it is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, and that <hi>Maron</hi> was really Orthodox and a Saint, and not an Heretick. <hi>Gabriel Sionita,</hi> and ſince him <hi>Abraham Ecchellenſis,</hi> formed alſo a deſign of making an Apology for thoſe of their Nation, and for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended St. <hi>Maron;</hi> but theſe Apologies have not appeared abroad in the World. <hi>Fauſtus Nairon,</hi> the Kinſman and Succeſſour of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> hath lately undertaken to make that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy in a<note n="(1)" place="margin">Diſſert. de origine, nom. ac relig. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. Autore Fauſto Nairo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. Edit. Rom. Anno. <hi>1679.</hi>
                  </note> Diſſertation Printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein, according to the common Opinion of the <hi>Maronites,</hi> he proves by the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> St. <hi>John Chryſoſtome</hi> and ſome other Authours, that <hi>Maron</hi> from whom the <hi>Maronites</hi> take their Name, in the ſame who lived about the year 400. and who is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>Menology</hi> of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> He adds that the Diſciples of that Abbot <hi>Maron</hi> ſpread themſelves over all <hi>Syria,</hi> where they built ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Monaſteries, and amongſt others a very famous one called by the Name of <hi>Maron</hi> near
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107630:83"/>the River <hi>Orontes.</hi> This Authour farther pretends, that all thoſe <hi>Syrians</hi> who were not infected with Hereſie, ſheltered themſelves with the Diſciples of Abbot <hi>Maron,</hi> whom the Hereticks of thoſe times called <hi>Maronites</hi> for that reaſon. It were to be wiſhed that M. <hi>Nairon,</hi> had brought Arguments of leſs diſtance from thoſe times to prove that Opinion; and I think we ought not abſolutely to give credit to the Authority of <hi>Thomas</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Kfartab,</hi> who lived, as it is pretended, towards the Eleventh age, though he was of the Sect of the <hi>Monothelites:</hi> For if theſe Authours be carefully examined, they will not be found very exact in matters of Hiſtory, and moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they relate for Matters of Antiquity, what happened in their own time, and which they have even drawn out of the Books of the <hi>Maronites,</hi> ſince their Reconciliation with <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which hath greateſt appearance of truth in the Apology of M. <hi>Nairon</hi> for thoſe of his Countrey, is the Argument he uſes againſt the Teſtimony of <hi>Gulielmus Tyrius,</hi> who is an Authour exact enough, and who hath ſpoken of the Hereſie of the <hi>Maronites,</hi> as an ocular wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He affirms that <hi>Gulielmus Tyrius</hi> took moſt part of his Hiſtory, out of the Annals of <hi>Said Ebn Batrik,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Eutychius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and ſeeing <hi>Eutychius</hi> is not very exact in a great many matters of fact which he relates, it is not to be thought ſtrange that <hi>Gulielmus Tyrius</hi> hath fallen into the ſame miſtakes. <hi>Eutychius,</hi> ſays M. <hi>Nairon,</hi> affirms that <hi>Maron</hi> the <hi>Monothelite</hi> lived in the time of the Emperour <hi>Mauritius;</hi> and nevertheleſs <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notheliſm</hi>

The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Gulielmus Tyrius</hi> is not ſo much made uſe of in the matter in hand, for what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates out of the Annals of <hi>Eutychius;</hi> as for his own Teſtimony, ſpeaking of a thing that happened in his own time, under <hi>Aymeric</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who made the <hi>Maronites</hi> of that Countrey abjure their pretended Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Religion and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Religion of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> being for moſt part but a medly of the Chriſtian and Jewiſh Religions, we have thought it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to give an Abridgment thereof in this place, to the end that they who travell into the <hi>Levant,</hi> may lay aſide a great many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices that they have conceived againſt that Religion, and that they may conſider that it is indebted to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for all the good that is in it, eſpecially in relation to Morality. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who was perſwaded that all Religion ought to be founded on the word of God, and not upon the Dictates of Men, was obliged to take to himſelf the Title of God's Meſſenger; and the more to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſtians, he feigned himſelf to be that <hi>Paraclet</hi> or Comforter promiſed in the Goſpel. Nay he hath borrowed part of their Maximes, and acknowledg'd Our Lord to be a great Prophet inſpired by the Spirit of God. On the other hand, being willing alſo to gain the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of theſe two to make but one more perfect Religion, he hath brought into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reformation a great part of Judaiſm: and that makes the <hi>Mahometans</hi> pretend, that the two Laws, aſwell that of <hi>Moſes</hi> as that of Our Saviour, are at preſent aboliſhed, and that ſo, Men are obliged to embrace <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:107630:87"/>if they would be true Believers. They conſeſs that both theſe Laws have been grounded upon the word of God; but ſtill add, that they are no longer in force, ſince he hath empower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Mahomet</hi> to reform Religion. There are even ſome <hi>Mahometans</hi> who affirm, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Jews</hi> nor Chriſtians can have certain and infallible Principles of their Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Sacred writings have been corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The <hi>Jews,</hi> ſay they, loſt their Law and all their Holy Books during the time of the Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and what they call Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Books, are not ſo indeed, but onely ſome ſcraps of thoſe Ancient Books which the <hi>Jews</hi> have pieced together, as well as they could after their Captivity. As for the Chriſtians, they ſay that the Books of the New Teſtament have been corrupted by the different Sects, that have ariſen amongſt the ſame Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> then feigned, that during the ſpace of 23 Years, God ſent him by the Miniſtery of the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> a certain Number of Pieces of Writing, whereof he compoſed the Book which is called the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> and that Book is to them the Holy Scripture, being the chief ground-work of their Religion. But as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> beſides the 24 Books of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there is alſo the <hi>Talmud</hi> which contains their Traditions; ſo the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have their <hi>Aſſonna,</hi> that declares to them the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which they are to follow. They have likewiſe Expoſitions on thoſe Books, to which they ſubmit; and beſides, they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, aſwell as we, that which is of Precept, from that which is onely Advice.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:107630:88"/>
               <p>The Chief Article of their Belief is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Unity of God; and therefore it is their ordinary ſaying; <hi>There is no other God but God; God is one;</hi> and they call thoſe Idolaters, who acknowledge any Number in the Deity, thereby, condemning the Trinity of Perſons which the Chriſtians acknowledge to be in God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Fundamental Article of their Religion conſiſts in theſe words, <hi>Mahomet is the Meſſenger of God.</hi> By that they pretend to exclude all other Religions, becauſe they ſay that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is the moſt excellent, and laſt of all the Prophets whom God was to ſend to Mankind: And as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was abrogated by the coming of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo, in their Opinion, the Chriſtian Religion was not to ſubſiſt any longer, after the appearance of their Prophet <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They who introduce a new Religion, ought to ſhew ſome Miracles, that ſo their words may be the better believed. And therefore the <hi>Mahometans</hi> attribute ſome to their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatour. They affirm that he made water flow out of his Fingers, and that pointing to the Moon with his Finger he clave it aſunder. They ſay alſo, that Stones, Trees and Beaſts acknowledged him to be the true Prophet of God, and they ſaluted him in theſe Terms, <hi>You are the true meſſenger of God.</hi> They farther affirm, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> went in one Night, from <hi>Mecha</hi> to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> from whence he aſcended up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where he ſaw Paradiſe and Hell; that he talked with God, though that be an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107630:88"/>reſerved to the Bleſſed after their death; and that, in fine, he came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ſame Night, and was again in <hi>Mecha</hi> before Day.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Miracles of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> aſcribe ſome alſo to their Saints, but with this difference, that they are not to be compared to thoſe of their Prophet. They ſpeak very well of God and his Perfections, removing from him every thing that can mark the leaſt imperfection. They farther add, that theſe Angels who execute the Commands of god, and affirm that there is no diſtinction of Sex a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. They farther add, that theſe Angels differ in Dignity, and that they are appointed for certain Offices aſwell in Heaven as on Earth; and that, in fine, they write down the Actions of Men. They attribute extraordinary Power to the Angel <hi>Gabriel;</hi> to wit, that he can in the ſpace of an Hour come down from Heaven to Earth, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw a Mountain with one Feather of his wing. The Angel <hi>Aſrael</hi> is appointed to take care of the Souls of thoſe that dye: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther named <hi>Eſraphil</hi> holds a great Trumpet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at his Mouth, ready to ſound to the Day of Judgment. It would be needleſs and tedious to mention the Employments of the other Angels. They believe the General Reſurrection of the Dead, and reckon up all the Signs that are to precede it: For then they pretend an <hi>Anti-Mahomet</hi> ſhall come, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall deſcend from Heaven to kill him, and eſtabliſh the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, to which they add a great many more Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances concerning <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107630:89"/>Beaſt that is to come out of <hi>Mecha.</hi> They affirm beſides, that at that time all living Creatures ſhall die, that the Mountains ſhall fly in the Air like Birds, and that, at length the Heavens ſhall melt and drop upon the Earth. Nevertheleſs they ſay that ſome time after, God ſhall renew the Earth, and then he ſhall raiſe the Dead, who ſhall appear ſtark naked from Head to Foot; but that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Saints, Doctours and Juſt Men ſhall be cloathed with Garments, and carried by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Cherubims to the <hi>Empyrean</hi> Heaven; that for the reſt, they ſhall ſuffer Hunger, Thirſt and Nakedneſs, and that the Sun com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within a Mile over their Heads, they ſhall ſweat in a ſtrange manner, and endure many other Torments which we mention not. I ſhall onely obſerve, that they extend not the Pains which all are to ſuffer with Proportion to their Sins, beyond fifty thouſand Years. Farthermore it is not onely amongſt us that St. <hi>Michael</hi> is to be ſeen holding a Balance in his hand to weigh the good and bad Actions of Men, the <hi>Mahometans</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm alſo, that at the Day of Judgment there will be a Balance, wherein good and evil are to be weighed; that they whoſe good Deeds ſhall weigh more than their bad, ſhall goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paradiſe; and that, on the contrary, they whoſe Sins are more heavy than their good Actions, ſhall goe into Hell, unleſs the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Saints intercede for them.</p>
               <p>This Belief of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> concerning Paradiſe and Hell, comes pretty near that of the <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians, eſpecially of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entals. 'Tis farther to be obſerv'd, that they
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107630:89"/>acknowledge a kind of Purgatory; for they hold that they who dye in the Faith, whoſe Sins nevertheleſs have been heavier than their good Actions, and who have not been aſſiſted by the Interceſſions of the Juſt; they hold, I ſay, that theſe ſhall ſuffer in Hell in Proportion to their Sins, and that afterward, they ſhall goe into Paradiſe. And much after the ſame manner the Eaſtern Church acknowledges alſo a Purgatory, without admitting any other place beſides Hell.</p>
               <p>Beſides that General Judgment wherein the <hi>Mahometans</hi> believe that God himſelf in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhall make all Men give account of their Actions, they acknowledge alſo a particular Judgment, which they call the Torment of the Grave; and that Judgment, in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is performed in this manner. So ſoon as any one is dead and buried, two of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Angels, of which the one is called <hi>Munzir,</hi> and the other <hi>Nekir,</hi> come and interrogate the dead Perſon, asking what Belief he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and the Prophet, and concerning the Law and the <hi>Kiblé,</hi> that is to ſay, to what ſide one is to turn in Praying to God. The Juſt are then to anſwer, Our God is he that hath created all things: our Faith is the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman</hi> and Orthodox Faith: and the true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Prayers is the <hi>Kiabé.</hi> Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers on the contrary not knowing what to anſwer, are condemned to ſuffer great Pains.</p>
               <p>In the General Reſurrection, they pretend that thoſe who are deſtin'd for Paradiſe, ſhall, before they enter into it, drink of the water of certain Fountains appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and that every Prophet ſhall have his
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107630:90"/>Fountain or particular Source, where he and his followers ſhall drink. The Fountain where <hi>Mahomet</hi> and all of his Sect are to drink, ſhall be much larger than that of all other Prophets, and ſhall contain in length aſmuch extent of ground as one can travell in a Month. there ſhall be, ſay they, on the brinks of that Fountain, more Lavers than there are Stars in the Firmament, and its water ſhall be ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Honey, and whiter than Milk. They who once drink of it ſhall never thirſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>It is very probable that all theſe things are rather parables than true Relations: And therefore we are not always to take literally what we find in the Books of <hi>Mahometan</hi> Doctours and other Orientals; in which ſenſe we ought to underſtand a great part of that which they ſay of Paradiſe and Hell. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the Deſcription they make of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, they affirm that it is all full of Musk; that its Buildings are of Bricks of Gold and Silver; that they who have once entered into it, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come out again; that their Cloaths never wear out; that all ſorts of delicious meats are there; and that whatever one deſires to have, comes ready dreſt to their hand; that none are ſubject to ſleep in that place, nor to the other Neceſſities of the Body; that there are Divine and Celeſtial Women and Virgins there, who are free from all incommodities. And in this manner they deſcribe their Paradiſe. As for Hell, they ſay that Unbelievers ſhall there remain Eternally with the Devils; that they ſhall be tormented by Serpents bigger than Camels, and Scorpions greater than Mules,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107630:90"/>Aſwell as by Fire and Scalding water; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnt and turned into a Coal, God ſhall raiſe them again for freſh Sufferings, and that ſo their Torments ſhall never have an end.</p>
               <p>They commonly believe Predeſtination, and ſay that good and evil onely happen becauſe God hath ſo ordained. He hath, ſay they, from all Eternity written on a Table, the things that are, and are to be, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they can be otherwiſe. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and wickedneſs of the Infidel are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much according to his Knowledge and Deſire, as the Obedience and Faith of the Believer. They farther ſay, that if it be asked why God hath created the wicked and unbelievers, we are to anſwer, that it does not become us to inquire too curiouſly into the Secrets of God; that he does what he pleaſes, and no man ought to ask the reaſon of what he does. And therefore a true follower of <hi>Mahomet</hi> ought to ſay, I believe in God, in his Angels, in his Books and in the Day of Judgment. I far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe that good and evil happen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he hath ordained, and that, in fine, it is he that hath created both.</p>
               <p>As to Believers who dye without repentance, they maintain that they continue in ſuſpence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death, and that God diſpoſes of them according to his good Will and Pleaſure; that ſome he pardons, and condemns others to ſuffer the Puniſhment which they deſerve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Sins, being ſtill aſſured to goe into Paradiſe after the Expiation of their Crimes. They are, in fine, perſwaded that God pardons all ſorts of Sins, except Atheiſm and Idolatry: and that is the reaſon why in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107630:91"/>the Prayers they make for the dead, they pray for the wicked aſwell as for the good. They have a great eſteem for Prayers, Charity, and other pious Actions that are performed for the dead, becauſe that contributes to the Comfort and repoſe of Souls. They have a kind of Office appointed for that purpoſe, where are ſet down the Prayers to be ſaid at Buryings, and the <hi>Surrates</hi> of Chapters of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> that are to be read at the Grave of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed; which reading being done, they who have been employed in that Office, ſay with a loud voice, <hi>With all our heart we give to this Perſon deceaſed, the Merit of all our reading.</hi> It is not out of Vanity that they erect Tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones over their Graves, but that Paſſengers may remember to pray to God for the reſt of their Souls.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mahometans</hi> not onely perform the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Acts of Faith, but alſo accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all their Sins, which they confeſs in the Preſence of God, and to him alone. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſay they, is but Repentance for the Sins which we have committed, with a firm reſolution not to fall into the like again.</p>
               <p>Their Morality conſiſts in doing good, and eſchewing Evil: which is the reaſon why they examine very carefully the Nature of Virtues and Vices; and their Caſuiſts are no leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile than ours are. I ſhall here mention ſome of their Principles, whence we may the more eaſily judge of their Morality. They are ſo perſwaded that all Actions which are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Faith, are Sins, that they maintain that he who denies it, loſes the Merit of all his good Works; that as often as he lies
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107630:91"/>with his Wife, he commits ſo many Adulteries; in a word, that all he does during that time cannot be acceptable to God, untill he hath repented of his Sin; and that then he becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a <hi>Muſſulman</hi> or Believer anew, and muſt marry again a ſecond time: and if he hath made the Journey to <hi>Mecha,</hi> he muſt make it over again, becauſe all his good Actions have been blotted out by that denial; and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance cannot again revive them.</p>
               <p>When they demand any thing of God in Prayer, they are to reſign themſelves wholly to his Will, and ſay to him, O my God, I beg of thee, not to grant what I ask, if it be not for my good. And when they have obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God the favour they deſired, they ought to thank him, confeſſing themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Mercies they have received, and that of themſelves they are able to doe nothing.</p>
               <p>They recommend nothing ſo much, as truſt and confidence in God, whom they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be their onely ſupport; and they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly praiſe Humility, which, according to them conſiſts, in eſteeming others more than themſelves.</p>
               <p>They give excellent Precepts for bridling the Paſſions, and ſhunning vice. If thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, ſay they, have Hell ſhut its ſeven Gates, take heed thou ſin not with thy ſeven Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which are they Eyes, the Ears, the Tongue, the Hand, the Foot, the Belly and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they dare not name: and they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon up all the particulars from which every one of theſe Parts ought to abſtain. Slander and Backbiting is one of the Vices againſt which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107630:92"/>they moſt declame; and there is nothing they ſo much condemn as the Cenſurings of other People, even when they are true. Upon that Principle they ground this Maxime, that we ought not to ſpeak of things that are hidden from us. For inſtance, they forbid to ſay, ſuch a Man is dead, or ſhall dye in the Faith, becauſe it belongs not to us to judge of things which God hath concealed: that, ſay they, can be done onely, when the Prophet hath ſpoken of them; and ſo it may be affirmed, that <hi>Abubekir, Homer, Oſman</hi> and <hi>Haly</hi> deſerve Paradiſe. For the ſame reaſon alſo, they ſay, that it is not lawfull to ſay that ſuch a Perſon is dead in Unbelief, or that he deſerves Hell; unleſs they ſpeak of thoſe who are expreſly mentioned by the Prophet, as the Devil, <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaheb</hi> and <hi>Abugehel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I wave the reſt of their Morals, in reſpect that what I have alledged is ſufficient to ſhew the Nature of it; and I dare affirm it is not ſo remiſs as that of ſome Caſuiſts of our Age. Onely let me add, that they have a great many good Precepts concerning the Duties of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons towards their Neighbour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they alſo preſcribe Rules of Civility. They have alſo written of the Duty of Subjects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Prince; and one of their Maximes is, that it is never lawfull to kill him, nay nor to ſpeak ill of him under Pretext that he is a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>The Devotion of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> extends even to Holy Names: as when they pronounce the Name of God, they muſt bow, and add thereunto, moſt High, moſt Bleſſed, moſt Mighty, moſt Excellent, or the like, If one
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107630:92"/>has pronounced the Name of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he muſt add, may God augment his Graces: to the Names of other Meſſengers, they add, that God is ſatisfied with them. And, laſtly, to the Names of other Doctours, they add, may the Mercy of God reſt upon them.</p>
               <p>There are no Monachal Conſtitutions that ſo much oblige Monks to obey their Superiour, as the Precepts of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Doctours oblige Diſciples to reſpect their Maſters, whom they ought to obey in all things, without gain-ſaying, and in whoſe Preſence they are not to ſpeak too loud.</p>
               <p>As they diſtinguiſh that which is of Divine obligation from what is onely of Humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and that which is of Precept from that which is onely of Council; ſo there are to be found amongſt them Devout People that obey Councils as punctually as Commands, as for inſtance, to goe to Prayers at Nine in the Morning, which is not of obligation, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate themſelves there twice at leaſt, or eight times at moſt. In fine, the <hi>Mahometans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Belief and Morality, have alſo their Ceremonies, which they ſtrictly enough ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. To diſtinguiſh them from the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are obliged to goe to Prayers but three times a day, <hi>Mahomet</hi> obliges his Followers to pray five times a day, as a Mark of greater Sanctity. They have a great many Traditions about the manner of praying, which would be tedious to relate.</p>
               <p>They have ſome Prayers that are neceſſary upon Divine obligation, and others onely or Counſel and Decency. There are ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which being neglected, render the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107630:93"/>Prayer invalid. For inſtance, in the Noon and Afternoon Prayers, which are of Divine obligation, they muſt reade them with a low Voice; but in that which is ſaid in the Morning, and at Night before they go to bed, it is to be read aloud, if there be an <hi>Imam,</hi> that is to ſay, a Prieſt preſent. But if one pray alone, it is a Matter indifferent. Moreover, the Men ought at firſt to lift up their Hands to the Tip of their Ears, and the Women onely to their Jaws. When one ſtandeth having the Right Hand upon the Left, if he be a Man, he ought to place his Hands below his Navel; and if ſhe be a Woman, ſhe is to put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Boſom. To pray with Order, they muſt accompany the <hi>Imam</hi> with a low voice, and imitate all he doeth. I ſhould be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious if I would reckon up the particular Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures they have in praying, eſpecially when they proſtrate themſelves, and touch the ground with their Forehead and Noſe: that is better underſtood by ſeeing them when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a are at Prayers.</p>
               <p>Their Modeſty at Prayers is ſo much the greater, that they are obliged to obſerve a great many things, if they expect to be heard: for their Prayers are eſteemed ineffectual, if they talk or laugh in time of Prayer ſo as they may be heard; it is the ſame, if they weep too loud, by reaſon of any Misfortune that hath befallen them, or for other Cauſes, unleſs it be becauſe mention hath been made of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe or Hell, for then the Prayer is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs good. There are alſo a great many other Caſes which render then Prayers null, as to ſcratch three times in one Place, to paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107630:93"/>the <hi>Imam</hi> during a Proſtration, to advance or goe the ſpace of two ranks, to turn their Face from the <hi>Kiblé,</hi> to begin a Prayer, when they hear the <hi>Imam</hi> begin another, to commit any miſtake in reading, to ſalute any one vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily; for if it happen by inadvertency, the fault is expiated, by making a Proſtration, which is the uſual Penance in that caſe.</p>
               <p>They are moreover prohibited to pray to God in a habit, wherein they commonly work at home, and in which they would not pay a viſit to Perſons of Quality. Nor can they pray to God before the fire, though they are not hindred from doing it by a Candle or Lamp. But we ſhould never make an end, if we mentioned exactly all that they are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to do during the time of Prayer. Let us now ſay ſomewhat of their Waſhings. Amongſt the <hi>Mahometans</hi> it is of Divine Obligation, to waſh the Mouth, the Face, and then the whole Body: and the Tradition of <hi>Mahomet</hi> enjoyns, that this Ablution be made with intention of doing ſo; that for better cleanſing the Body, Water is to be poured three times upon it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the right Shoulder to the left, then upon the Head, and afterwards upon all the parts of the Body. If one break wind during the <hi>Abdeſt,</hi> or Ablution, all that hath been done is good for nothing; for then the Ablution is null.</p>
               <p>They reckon amongſt the Commands of God, the waſhing of the Face once and the Arms up to the Elbow, to waſh the fourth part of the Head and the Feet once: and the tradition of <hi>Mahomet</hi> ordains the Hands to be waſhed three times, the Teeth to be cleanſed with a certain
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107630:94"/>kind of Wood, and the Mouth after that to be waſhed three times, and the Noſe as often, without interruption after one hath once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; then the Ears are to be waſhed with the reſt of the Water that was uſed for the Head. They are always to begin their waſhings by the right ſide: and when they waſh their Hands or Feet, they are obliged to begin with the Fingers and Toes. There are many things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that render theſe Ablutions null: but we have inſiſted but too long upon theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>What I have hitherto ſaid of the Religion of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> is extracted out of a Book of <hi>Mahometan</hi> Divinity written by one of their Doctours who lived in the laſt age. That Doctour profeſſes to follow the Doctrine moſt generally received at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the moſt approved by good Men. This is worth the obſerving, becauſe the <hi>Mahometans</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into a great many Sects, not to ſpeak of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who differ much from the <hi>Turks.</hi> And that we may have ſome knowledge of theſe Sects, I ſhall relate what that <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Divine hath judiciouſly ſaid of them, and which deſerves to be taken notice of.</p>
               <p>He affirms that the matters which concern their Religion are indeed, written in their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Books; but that there are part of them which are obſcure and hard to be underſtood, and that none but the Learned can dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: which has been the will of God, to the end that the Learned ſhould buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſtudy of theſe Books, and teach his mind to others. Seeing theſe Books are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, the Interpreters happen many times to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107630:94"/>miſtake; but their Errours are not Sins, and it is even the will of God that they who have not applied themſelves to ſtudy, ſhould follow the judgement of Doctours, without examining too ſcrupulouſly, whether or not they tell the truth, becauſe it is their part to ſubmit; and if they be deceived, they are not therefore guilty of Sin.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who came after <hi>Mahomet,</hi> though they have written many things for the Confirmation and Explication of the Law, yet they could not write all; beſides that, there was no great Neceſſity for it in thoſe times, when there were not ſo many Novelties, and ſo many Caſes of Conſcience, as have happened ſince. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the number of Believers encreaſed, they began to be divided in opinions, and it was Neceſſary that ſome ſhould apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſtudy of the Law, that they might digeſt into writing the Precepts which they drew out of Divine Books. And that gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the different Sects of Doctours: for every one explained the Law according to their Capacities and Talents, and gave their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations to the People. So that, in a ſhort time the People were divided into Factions: ſome followed <hi>Abuhanifé;</hi> others <hi>Chaſihié;</hi> ſome <hi>Maliké;</hi> others <hi>Ahmed;</hi> others again <hi>Dudzahimé;</hi> In a word, the number of theſe Doctours was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, and hath continued ſo to this preſent.</p>
               <p>After all, theſe Sects have all the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief as to the Fundamentals of the Faith, but they differ much one from another as to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Ceremonies: which diverſity, ſay they, has undoubtedly come to paſs by the permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God; ſo that there is no danger to their

                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:107630:97"/>followers, for there is no Sect wherein one may not be ſaved. However, the Sect of <hi>Abuhaniſé</hi> is to be preferred before all others, becauſe he, being the moſt Ancient and beſt inſtructed, hath explained the difficulties the beſt of any: and he ought to be followed eſpecially in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Morals; and therefore it is more merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to follow his Sentiments, than thoſe of the other Doctours that came after him. In that ſenſe theſe words are to be underſtood, <hi>I am of the Sect of</hi> Abuhaniſé <hi>in what relates to Actions, the Worſhip of God and the Ceremonies. Ireceive all that he hath drawn from the Word of God and Traditions. I have choſen his Opinions for regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my Actions.</hi> Thus ye have in a few words the Sentiment of our <hi>Mahometan</hi> Doctour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sects which are very numerous in his Religion, and which occaſion no Schiſm nor Diviſion that can be prejudicial to the State: For the Fundamental Articles of <hi>Mahometaniſme</hi> conſiſt onely in Profeſſing that there is but one God, and that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is his Meſſenger, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exact in Prayers and Almſdeeds, in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecha,</hi> and in obſerving the Faſt of <hi>Ramazan.</hi> Theſe five Principal Articles contain others of leſs importance: for that of Prayer ought always to be attended with whatever can render the Prayer pure, ſuch as are Ablutions; and Circumciſion alſo belongeth to that External Purity which ought to be the Sign of the Internal. I might enlarge more on this Subject: But I think what I have already mentioned will be ſufficient to make known the Religion of the <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
